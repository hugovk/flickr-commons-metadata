A social  oprganisation's flag I'm guessing. Our group will post here if we find out.\nWe learn elsewhere that crane rides like this were conducted during Navy Week at Garden Island up to the 1950s, sometimes using the famous 250 ton hammerhead crane [the demolition of which is now being discussed]  but we don't think the crane rides could happen today.

This information comes from Kim Dunstan of Melbourne, RAN 1958-1967, who does a lot of investigation of our photos, and sometimes extensively so. Kim tells us the flag seen here above the slide chute is the naval ensign of Siam, now Thailand, and probably from the WWI era.\n\nWe agree. Look closely at your enlarged image and you can see the similarity here: \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flying_Naval_Ensign_of_Thailand.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flying_Naval_Ensign_of_Thailan...</a>\n\nKim also notes that there is an officer in a foreign naval uniform - black epaulettes, collar  and dark tie, where an RAN officer's tunic is buttoned to the throat and collar - standing below the crane talking to a lady. The point is, a man in the same uniform can be seen standing fourth from the left in your image of a naval launch, several photos along at Object 00010453. Effectively this ties these two images to the same occasion, and dates the naval launch image for you as Dec. 12, 1931, same as here. \n\nWe think the men in the launch are those who did entertainment for the children, with a diver looking for 'lost children,' as described in the linked newspaper articles under the companion 'crane basket'  image.
