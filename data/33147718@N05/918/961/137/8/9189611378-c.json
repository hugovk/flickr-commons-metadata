The Brisbane River isn't a patch on Sydney Harbour, but it's nonetheless quite beautiful in its own right (when not in flood)...throughout much of the 20th century the locals treated it as little more than a drain...thankfully that's now largely a thing of the past.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-9189611378-72157634434388737", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/9189611378/#comment72157634475640284", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1372909736", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] what other pic were you referring to?
