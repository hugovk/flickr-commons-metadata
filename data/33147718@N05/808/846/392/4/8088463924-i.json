In 1934 GEORGE STAGE was about to be broken up when Australian author and sailor Andrew Villiers bought the vessel, renaming it after his favourite author. Villiers sailed JOSEPH CONRAD around the world with a crew of mostly young sailors, visiting Australian shores in late 1935. The vessel is now a part of the collection at the Mystic Seaport museum in Connecticut.\n\nAndrew Lindsay (back row, third from right) was washed overboard while sailing along the Australian coastline, however was promptly rescued.
