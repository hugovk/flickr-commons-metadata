In 1934 GEORGE STAGE was about to be broken up when Australian author and sailor Andrew Villiers bought the vessel, renaming it after his favourite author. Villiers sailed JOSEPH CONRAD around the world with a crew of mostly young sailors, visiting Australian shores in late 1935. The vessel is now a part of the collection at the Mystic Seaport museum in Connecticut.\n\nAndrew Lindsay was washed overboard while sailing along the Australian coastline, however was promptly rescued. Flickr user Beachcomberaustralia provided the useful link to this SMH article mentioning the incident: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/RYnW38\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/RYnW38</a>\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s William Hall collection. The Hall collection combines photographs from both William J Hall and his father William Frederick Hall. The images provide an important pictorial record of recreational boating in Sydney Harbour, from the 1890s to the 1930s \u2013 from large racing and cruising yachts, to the many and varied skiffs jostling on the harbour, to the new phenomenon of motor boating in the early twentieth century. The collection also includes studio portraits and images of the many spectators and crowds who followed the sailing races.\n\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
