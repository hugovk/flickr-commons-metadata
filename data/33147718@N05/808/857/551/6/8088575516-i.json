In 1934 GEORGE STAGE was about to be broken up when Australian author and sailor Andrew Villiers bought the vessel, renaming it after his favourite author. Villiers sailed JOSEPH CONRAD around the world with a crew of mostly young sailors, visiting Australian shores in late 1935. The vessel is now a part of the collection at the Mystic Seaport museum in Connecticut.\n\nFlickr user Beachcomberaustralia provided this useful link to a SMH article mentioning the visit: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/RYnW38\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/RYnW38</a>\n\nThe National Film and Sound Archive hold footage of this visit, including the sailors singing the song 'Rolling Home' accompanied by an accordian: <a href=\"http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=joseph conrad;querytype=;rec=5;resCount=10\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFSA entry</a> \n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J.
