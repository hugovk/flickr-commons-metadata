This photograph is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum's collection of nitrate negatives taken by Harold Nossiter and his son Harold Nossiter Junior in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nHarold Nossiter (senior) was a noted Sydney sailor in the 1920s and 1930s who became the first Australian to skipper a yacht around the world under an Australian flag.\n\nThe images in the collection depict the people, places and vessels encountered by the Nossiter family as they sailed on yachts UTIEKAH II along the NSW coast, and SIRIUS during the world cruise.\n\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
