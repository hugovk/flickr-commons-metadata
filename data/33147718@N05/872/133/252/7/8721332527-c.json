'Justice' was put in position on 9/11/1878. The next statue to be added to this corner was 'Mercy', which appears to have been placed in the upper niche in ca. September 1879...the statue was evidently completed by mid August 1879...presumably it would have been added soon afterwards. So this pic must have been taken sometime between 9/11/1878 and ?September 1879.
