March 1887...for sources, see the comments accompanying this later pic, which shows the DJ's building completed, but the GPO clock tower still without bells or clock faces - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2554622065/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2554622065/</a>\n\nMaybe the date range can be narrowed further if we can establish when work on the DJ's building commenced. Note that in this pic we see some scaffolding still in place at the GPO. One newspaper report indicates that the scaffolding which had been erected for the construction of the GPO tower was removed by ca. March 1886...so that might be another date marker...\n\nUPDATE ... various digitised newspaper hits tend to suggest that construction of the new DJ's building was under way by ca. February 1886...eg see this SMH item re a stone-mason's dispute in column 2 <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1402838\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1402838</a> ;  so maybe we're looking at ca. Feb-March-April 1886...the early stages of construction.\n\nAnother wonderful image!", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-8721378499-72157633453468872", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8721378499/#comment72157633444268601", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1368148482", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] Fantastic thank you!
