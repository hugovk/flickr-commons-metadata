Same laundry powder...and I'm about 99% convinced she's the same girl (same watch, same pearls, same floral thingy, same dress, same fringe curls)...and I'd say both pics were taken during the same photo shoot!\n\nAlas, for the time being, Ms Luxgirl's identity remains elusive...I had hoped she was a famous actress or singer and that we'd find an advert where she was quoted espousing the virtues of Lux...though I dare say it's possible another version of this advert might turn up somewhere which will mention her by name...I wish they'd had the foresight to put a few barcodes on these flappers! I stumbled across this <i>Home</i> advert whilst looking (unsuccessfully) for a photo of pianist Edith Harrison...maybe she'll turn up in the tabloids!\n\nIt would be interesting to see whether any versions of this advert which involve the pic from the ANMM collection turn up in the various newspapers and magazines. My guess is the  advertisers preferred the pic we see in the <i>Home</i> and that the ANMM pic was a reject...which is maybe why the slide remained in Hall's possession...and hence survived... \n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons] Note how Hall's slide of the Lux girl is numbered 4294...whereas the pics of Peggy Petite (presumably taken in 1927), were numbered 4324. If Hall's numbering more or less reflects the chronological sequence in which the pics were taken, it's possible that these Lux pics predate the PP pics...but perhaps only by a matter of weeks...got any thoughts on Hall's numbering system?", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-7363597466-72157636142559345", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "7363597466"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681537}
