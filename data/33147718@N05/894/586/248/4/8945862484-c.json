She was originally owned by the Queensland Steam Navigation Company.  After another owner, she came to the Port Jackson Steam Boat Company in January 1877 and stayed with the various forms of the Manly ferry company until 1909.  <b>She was renamed BRIGHTSIDE in 1887</b> and sank in June 1897. She was converted into a cargo ferry in 1902 and worked the Manly run in that role until 1908.
