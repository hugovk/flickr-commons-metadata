Photographs in this archival collection depict scenes, landscapes and tourist attractions from around the world, including Canada, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, United Kingdom, Singapore, Jamaica, Malaysia, United States, Malta, New Zealand and Australia. The collection also features HMA Ships SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA, CANBERRA and TINGIRA.\n\nJohn Berchmans Kiley was born on 29 January 1910 and joined the Royal Australian Navy in 1925. He began his naval service on HMAS TINGIRA, a ship for boy sailors moored at Rose Bay in Sydney, where he trained for 15 months. He went on to join HMAS SYDNEY and travelled to England, returning home on HMAS AUSTRALIA. Kiley also served in HMAS MELBOURNE, and undertook four years of training at HMAS CERBERUS studying a range of gunnery courses. Kiley reached the rank of Leading Seaman, and to his great disappointment was invalidated out of the navy around 1930 due to respiratory illness.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. \n\nObject number: ANMS0823[021]\n\nANMM Colelction Gift from Margaret Kiley-Balas"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "996", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1920-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1346024189", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1345603286"}, "originalsecret": "5658a570f1", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8303", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7835464178/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389684301}
