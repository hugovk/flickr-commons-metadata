The regatta was held on what is now Australia Day. If this is correct, then there's a good chance this pic was taken on a regatta flagship.\n\nStanley Bruce was Australian Prime Minister from February 1923 to October 1929. In this time, the various newspaper reports indicate he attended the Anniversary Regatta in Sydney on two occasions, 1926 and 1929. The 1926 regatta flagship was RMS Orvieto, the 1929 regatta flagship was the RMS Orsova (both Orient Line ships).\n\nThe various newspaper reports always listed the first tier VIPs who attended the Anniversary Regatta. Cullen appears to have attended the regatta in his capacity as Lieutenant-Governor of NSW throughout the 1920s - so he was present at both the regattas which Bruce attended. Here's his ADB entry plus portrait - <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cullen-sir-william-portus-5838\" rel=\"nofollow\">adb.anu.edu.au/biography/cullen-sir-william-portus-5838</a>\n\nBeyond tentatively identifying Cullen, I've drawn a blank with the others in this pic. I suspect  two of the chaps in nautical attire might be regatta organising officials. Someone who's up to speed on naval insignia might be able to come up with a list of 'possibles' for the other two. The chap beside Bruce looks as if he might be holding an official programme...but there's probably not enough resolution in the original negative for us to be able to read what's on the cover...though if we are looking at the front cover, then it appears not to be the 1926 programme...which appears in this PDF (p. 10) <a href=\"http://www.australiadayregatta.com.au/PDF/172nd ADR program Web.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.australiadayregatta.com.au/PDF/172nd%20ADR%20program%...</a> ; so maybe this is the 1929 regatta...there's evidently a copy of the 1929 programme in a collection at the Mitchell Library if anyone who lives nearby feels inclined to check it out. But for all we know this chap might be holding the luncheon menu!\n\n<a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_7RVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4559,1338216\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.google.com/newspapers?id=_7RVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LJYDA...</a> the Sydney Mail's brief item on the 1929 regatta\n\nA FEW DAYS LATER...\n\nAfter a bit more searching (via the long way around as usual) I've now managed to tentatively identify the chap on the lhs as Alfred Spain (1868-1954)...who was one of those earlier to mid 20th century Sydney figures who had an interest in just about everything (including yachting)...he appears in quite a few pics in the SLNSW collection <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=9312\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=9312</a> ;  at the 1946 regatta (here he's identified) <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=28347\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=28347</a> ;  at the 1949 regatta (pics possibly taken on board the regatta flagship HMAS Australia)  <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=30264\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=30264</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=30250\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=30250</a> ; here's his ADB entry <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/spain-alfred-8594\" rel=\"nofollow\">adb.anu.edu.au/biography/spain-alfred-8594</a> ; Spain was a member of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron and over the years also held various positions on the Anniversary Day regatta committee...he was chairman/vice-president in 1929...per the digitised newspapers, he attended the 1929 regatta...but I'm still trying to confirm whether he was at the 1926 regatta (presumably he was)...if this were 1926 I'd expect to see A.G. Milson among the VIPs...in 1926 Milson was the prime mover in the Anniversary Day regatta committee...he died in January 1928...so the fact that we don't see Milson here again suggests 1929...here's the SMH report on the 1929 regatta which lists the VIPs who attended <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16526493\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16526493</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-8390574071-72157632548815839", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8390574071/#comment72157632642199575", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1359505794", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] Fantastic research!

The GW is a recent addition to the NLA digitised newspaper stable...what an excellent choice!  \n\nAll up, I'd say the Gilgandra Weekly pic confirms that this Sam Hood pic was taken on RMS Orsova during the 1929 Anniversary Regatta...presumably in Sydney Harbour (per the SMH report the Orsova was anchored in Neutral Bay). \n\nThe digs seen in the GW pic are: Judge Backhouse, PM Stanley Bruce, D.L. Dowdell (Australian Orient Line general manager), Sir William Cullen, Lord Stonehaven, Archbishop Wright, NSW Premier Bavin, Col. Spain. As is evident, not all of them appear in the Sam Hood pic...I'd say there's now no doubt re Cullen...and I'd also suggest Col. Spain is now looking good (!)...it's a bit hard to tell, but I don't think the Archbishop or the Premier make it into Sam Hood's pic...the chap in the lighter suit wearing a bow-tie might be D.L. (Douglas) Dowdell, the Orient Line Australian branch general manager...looks like Judge Backhouse doesn't make it into Sam Hood's pic either... here's another pic of Dowdell wearing a bow-tie <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4003076\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4003076</a> ; and a non bow-tie pic <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17234580\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17234580</a> not yet quite convinced that's him in the Sam Hood pic...it's a pity the chap behind Col. Spain is obscured...he looks to have the then Rear Admiral's insignia on his epaulette (crown, crossed baton &amp; sword, one larger star...thanks wikipedia!)...the obvious candidate is Rear-Admiral Evans...he's on the SMH list of digs who attended the regatta;  I suspect the chap wearing what looks like an Orient Line cap might be Captain G.G. Thorne, then captain of the Orsova <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54175855\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54175855</a> ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article40822482\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article40822482</a> but that's also a speculator...I'm also beginning to suspect that the chap speaking to Lord Stonehaven might be John Garlick, then Sydney Chief Civic Commissioner, who the SMH indicates was president of the 1929 Anniversary Day Regatta committee...in many pics he's wearing specs, but not in all of them...most pics I've looked at are unconvincing eg <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=190560\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=190560</a> ...but this one stops me crossing him off the list just yet <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn6216876\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn6216876</a> ...in the Fairfax Collection pic we see then Brigadier-General Gordon Bennett (a Sydney Civic Commissioner) <a href=\"http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/011303/09/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.awm.gov.au/collection/011303/09/</a> , Rear-Admiral Evans, John Garlick and NSW MLA R.T.
