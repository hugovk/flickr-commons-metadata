Miss Kerr was giving her usual exhibition of swimming and diving at the north pier, when two lads, who were bathing near the jetty, were carried out of their depth by a strong-flowing current. The cries of the lads, whose ages were between 12 and 14, attracted the attention of Miss Kerr, who immediately went to their assistance. The lads were by this time about 100 yards from the jetty and 80 yards from the shore, and they were almost exhausted.   \nMiss Kerr rescued first the elder lad, and then went to the rescue of the other, and landed both safely. The lads suffered greatly from shock, but otherwise were none the worse for their misadventure, and were soon able to leave for their homes. There is no doubt that but for Miss Kerr's promptitude the lads would have been drowned.  \n</blockquote>\n\nFrom <i>The Argus</i> 3/10/1911 p.5", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8566042211-72157633024957848", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8566042211/#comment72157633027156887", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1363648457", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Wow thanks Beachcomber - was very interested to read about Beatrice rescuing those two boys :) What a fabulous story!", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-8566042211-72157633027156887", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8566042211/#comment72157633032441852", "realname": "Diane Marie Kramer", "path_alias": null, "author": "25386365@N06", "iconserver": "5492", "datecreate": "1363657276", "_content": "very cool photo and story!", "authorname": "she wolf-", "id": "33142378-8566042211-72157633032441852", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8566042211/#comment72157633034544628", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1363682336", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/25386365@N06] Yes, it's a terrific story to go with this photo at the same time and place,  and proves she was not just a 'show pony'.
