Fanny Stevenson (back left corner dressed in black) sits with a group of people on the verandah of her home Vailima.  The gifts, in the form of food, are placed in front of them on banana leaves.  'J. Davies photo / Samoa' appears stamped on the lower left corner and a handwritten inscription, 'Gifts of condolence to Mrs R.L. Stevenson', appears vertically along the left hand side of mount.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson authored several classic works of literature including 'Treasure Island' and 'Kidnapped'. Stevenson had moved to Samoa for his health and to distance himself from the pressure of the European literary scene.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly. \n\nPhotographer: J Davies\n\nObject no. 00016894"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1456", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1894-12-03 15:52:41", "lastupdate": "1346892230", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1346133200"}, "originalsecret": "848c1c6763", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8430", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7878359564/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389684227}
