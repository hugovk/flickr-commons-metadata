Four were built locally in Australia for the RAN; <i>Yarra, Swan, Parramatta, Warrego</i>. It is either <i>Parramatta</i> or <i>Warrego</i>, as they were completed with a twin 4-inch gun in X (rear) position; the others had single guns, these guns had the distinctive curved shield. The long fo'c'sle, curved break in the deck, the shelter deck infront of the bridge and the quadruple 0.5&quot; Vickers gun mount on top are other indicative features, as are the two davits at the stern for handling the sweeps.", "authorname": "the Magnificent Octopus", "id": "33142378-3275525968-72157634312438860", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/3275525968/#comment72157634417279455", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1372656977", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaputniq] Thanks for that and apologies for the delay in replying, we have noted this information in our database.", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-3275525968-72157634417279455", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3275525968"}, "flarchive:created": 1389684907}
