Just going on some of the other Hall pics...eg. the pics of Vernon Sellars and Patsy Hill...it looks as if the Hall pics were numbered by photoshoot or by job...I wonder whether the numbering might also reflect the chronological sequence in which the pics were taken...the Sellars/Hill pics are numbered 4129...so although one of the Sellars/Hill pics turned up in the Advertiser in 1928, it's possible that the Sellars/Hill pics predate the Peggy Petite pics (which, given what we know of Peggy's sudden rise to stardom, were probably taken in 1927)...", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-10030210243-72157636143966803", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/10030210243/#comment72157636414371845", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1381460773", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] Suggestion noted.
