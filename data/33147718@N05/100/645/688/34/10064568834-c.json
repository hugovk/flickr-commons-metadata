She was one of just a small number of six masted schooners to be built and just one 7 masted schooner was ever built!  They appeared to suffer from undue hull stress when in a following sea resulting in many losses and eventually the practice of building them was abandoned.  The state library of Victoria have a fine shot of her under sail but the upper yards are not deployed either through a lack of wind or for the reasons stated above.\nBelow is a brief explanation for the origins of the word &quot;Schooner&quot;\n&quot;The schooner is a fore-and-aft rigged vessel with at least two masts, named the fore and the main mast.\nAccording to the tradition the word schooner was first used in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1713 when a new vessel was launched at the shipyard of Andrew Robinson. It has been said that when the vessel entered the water that a spectator remarked Oh, how she scoons!, upon which Robinson replied: A scooner let her be. True or not, fore-and-aft vessels of the schooner type had been built before that date and are illustrated in Dutch paitings from the early 17th century.&quot;", "authorname": "swordscookie off for a few...", "id": "33142378-10064568834-72157636183847204", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/10064568834/#comment72157636378496496", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1381381144", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/miniop] Thanks for the location id!
