Peggy commenced quietly, but last night, at the gala dinner, showed herself to be a cabaret dancer of first brilliance.  Peggy Petite can dance, looks pretty, and has a happy knack of making friends by creating that intimate atmosphere between patrons and artists. As she skips from table to table one feels that this piquant little girl is speaking to everyone individually. This is the secret of her success, and the success of every cabaret artist. The sympathy created beween the performer and the onlooker -  personality - is the thing that counts most. </i>\n</blockquote>\n\nFrom <i>Sunday Times</i>(Sydney) 17/4/1927 p.15 - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/128513975\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/128513975</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-10030750573-72157636080128453", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/10030750573/#comment72157636088528683", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1380642664", "_content": "Peggy Petite might be Peggy Buxom by todays standards?

The thinness of too many public figures today seems driven by imitation of fashion models, but back to the 20's.  This was the age of the flapper which was a period when thin was the style, but as you observe, thinness maybe wasn't as thin as today.\n\nAs to young,  I'm wondering if the short hair with the styled curls would NOT have been associated with (teenagers and younger) youth at the time.
