For what it's worth, I can't make it out...so I'd say we're looking at pre 1901-1902.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I'd say the ramshackle establishment immediately opposite on Kangaroo Point might provide the best clues re establishing a 'latest date' for this pic. I suspect this is Birley Bros' saw mill which was evidently located on the very tip of Kangaroo Point in the 1880s and 1890s......had this  been Sydney, if we were lucky, the Illustrated Sydney News or the T&amp;CJ or the Sydney Mail would at some point have despatched a 'special' who would have duly produced an illustrated newspaper article...just so that 120 years on, we'd be able to identify the sawmill from a sketch or photo, which we'd track down courtesy of the digitised newspapers...but alas Birley Bros' sawmill barely rates a mention in the Brisbane newspapers of the day...hence I'm not sure...but sawmill or not, just looking at the QSA panorama (link above...hopefully it won't expire!), I'd be surprised if it survived the 1893 flood.\n\nHere's a similar view from the SLQ collection...taken somewhat earlier <a href=\"http://bishop.slq.qld.gov.au/view/action/singleViewer.do?dvs=1373089966602~920&amp;locale=en_US&amp;metadata_object_ratio=7&amp;show_metadata=true&amp;VIEWER_URL=/view/action/singleViewer.do?&amp;DELIVERY_RULE_ID=10&amp;frameId=1&amp;usePid1=true&amp;usePid2=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">bishop.slq.qld.gov.au/view/action/singleViewer.do?dvs=137...</a>\n\nAll up, my guess is this ANMM pic was taken in the period 1889-1893.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-7237769388-72157634501497613", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "7237769388"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681777}
