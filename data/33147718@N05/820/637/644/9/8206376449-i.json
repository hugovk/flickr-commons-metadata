These photos will provide valuable detailed information. MYRA TOO was built and raced by Sydney sailing identity Billy Barnett and was one of the most successful skiffs of its period. In 1951 MYRA TOO was the State, National and World Champion 18 footer.\n\nMYRA TOO\u2019s crew consisted of, at various times:  Skipper Billy Barnett, forward hand Sid Ferguson, sheet hand Fred Evennett, jib hand Andy Costyn, swinger Jack Davies and bailer boy Brian Stewart. Bill Barnett\u2019s brother Tommy would fill in if the crew were short of one member.\n\nWith thanks to Brian Stewart for providing additional historical details.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly. \n\nPhotographer: William Hall Collection\n\nObject no. 00013522\nRead our <a href=\"http://anmm.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/bringing-a-champion-back-to-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog</a> on the project to build a replica of this champion 18 footer. \n\nTo donate to the MYRA TOO project, please head over to the website of the <a href=\"http://ahssa.weebly.com/aost-funding-myra-too.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australian Open Skiff Trust</a> for more information."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "908", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1951-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1381973643", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1353541577"}, "originalsecret": "69f7cdf3fe", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8337", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8206376449/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389620765}
