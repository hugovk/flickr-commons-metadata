maybe a week or so earlier...However, just to upset this simple theory, the note accompanying the pic of Lottie Murdoch which appeared in the Sunday Times stated that the pic had been taken on her recent return from Europe...and it was then December 1927...\n\nPOST SCRIPT <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128524233\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128524233</a> ...a December 1927 Sunday Times pic of Mary Craven, also by Hall &amp; Co...Mary Craven was then evidently chief designer at Burlei...you can read all about her on Trove...and at the PHM, where they evidently have a bit of a Burlei collection...my hunch is that this pic of Mary Craven might have been taken at about the same time as the pic of Lottie Murdoch...and that both pics might have been intended for use in a Burlei promo...\n\nMaybe should have picked up on this one earlier...it comes up if you do a search of the digitised newspapers under 'Hall and Co'...needless to say, I discovered it whilst doing a page-by-page trawl thru the Sunday Times...another case of 'why do things the easy way first'...\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120535477\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120535477</a> the marvel that is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) still doesn't quite get everything...these Hall pics of 1920s Sydney socialites are an example of what doesn't turn up via a name search...you need to trawl thru a newspaper page by page to find these...link parked here for possible future reference...\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122805028\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122805028</a> Mrs Lenos comes up if you search for 'Hall Studio'...link parked here for possible future reference...\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page13811394\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page13811394</a> Marcia Steizer (another Hall pic)...link parked here for possible future reference\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page13810733\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page13810733</a> Dorothy Coffee...ditto\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128129671\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128129671</a> Helen Bruton...ditto\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128521182\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128521182</a> visiting Irish singer Sheila Kilgannon...ditto\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126053183\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126053183</a> Actress Enid Bennett (ST 1912)...ditto\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article117739068\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article117739068</a> Ida ?McManamy\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128123579\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128123579</a> Sydney socialite Thelma Houston", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-7158135825-72157639256552605", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "7158135825"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681583}
