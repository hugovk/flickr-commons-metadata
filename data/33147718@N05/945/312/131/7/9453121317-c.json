V.&quot; was founded in Halle, with the objective of commemorating Luckner's life and work, especially his role in safeguarding the city of Halle during April 1945. The Society also wishes to create a memorial and museum for Luckner in Halle, and to restore Luckners' yacht, Seeteufel, which is currently in a poor condition in Russia. Within a few months of its creation, the Society had over 100 members in 14 countries. The yacht has been restored and since 2010 has been made sea worthy.
