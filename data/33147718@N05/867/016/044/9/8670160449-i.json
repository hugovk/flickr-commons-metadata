Rayment was an active member of the Sydney Amateur Sailing Club throughout his life. SNOWDROP was buit of Huon Pine by Oscar Mackay and purchased by Rayment shortly after being launched in 1921. Rayment raced the vessel with success until 1937 when SNOWDROP was sold to Norman Brooker and renamed NAIAD IV.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s William Hall collection. The Hall collection combines photographs from both William J Hall and his father William Frederick Hall. The images provide an important pictorial record of recreational boating in Sydney Harbour, from the 1890s to the 1930s \u2013 from large racing and cruising yachts, to the many and varied skiffs jostling on the harbour, to the new phenomenon of motor boating in the early twentieth century. The collection also includes studio portraits and images of the many spectators and crowds who followed the sailing races.\n\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
