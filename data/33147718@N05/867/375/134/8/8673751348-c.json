If we assume this, then this date is most likely the correct one, unless this photograph was taken in Newcastle in which case the date is earlier. I'm not great with men's clothing unfortunately, but my first impression of these images was that they were taken in the 1900s. Here's the research I have summarised: \n\nJOHN ENA visited Australia numerous times throughout its career. In June 1895 it visited Port Germein in South Australia and visited the state again in December 1898 and June 1903. During its September 1895 visit to Newcastle, New South Wales, 12 seamen from the barque were charged with 'combining to disobey lawful commands'. They were sentenced to seven days' imprisonment with hard labour in Maitland Gaol. During its second visit to Newcastle in June 1901, one of the crew, Charlie Solinas committed suicide. At 11:23am on 16 May 1916, JOHN ENA arrived in Sydney from Melbourne with a load of oil from San Francisco. Another visit to Australia was made in 1919.\nApart from these, I couldn't see any other visits to Australia.  \n\nAlso, an interesting report: <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article95247262\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article95247262</a>\n\nEDIT: Check these out\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8677177720/\" title=\"Four-masted steel barque JOHN ENA at sea by Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8530/8677177720_79bb026b7d_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"79\" alt=\"Four-masted steel barque JOHN ENA at sea\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8676071131/\" title=\"Photograph of a painting of JOHN ENA at sea by Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8126/8676071131_afbda839c1_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"77\" alt=\"Photograph of a painting of JOHN ENA at sea\" /></a>", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-8673751348-72157633311864407", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8673751348/#comment72157633313886549", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1366797949", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons] Oh dear!
