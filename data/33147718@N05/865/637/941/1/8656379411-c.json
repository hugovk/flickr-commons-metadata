Morrison and Sinclair, Balmain, yesterday afternoon. As the craft ran down the ways Mrs. Adrian Knox named her the Morna, and broke a bottle of Australian wine on her bows. The guests were entertained in the saloon.  \n\nThe Morna, which is 65 feet long with a 13 feet beam, was designed by Mr. William Fife, of Fairlie, Scotland, to Sir Alexander's order, and the builders have produced a fine vessel. She will be used for cruising. A four-cylinder 12 horsepower Kelvin engine has been installed, which should develop about five knots an hour. The propeller is collapsible.\n\nThe interior of the yacht is finished in Queensland maple, with bronze and silver plate fittings. The accommodation comprises a saloon, a dining saloon, and a ladies' cabin. There are five bunks for guests and two for the crew in a well-fitted forecastle.\n\nThe hull is of teak, especially imported, with a frame work of colonial hardwood, and is copper-fastened throughout. The cockpit, which is self-emptying, has a watertight coaming around it to keep out tho deckwash. In the cockpit the carburetter is kept in a watertight box, and is under the control of the helmsman. The benzine tanks are on deck, and there is no danger from fire or explosion.\n\nThe mast and spars were also imported.   The smaller spars are of the patent hollow type. The mast will be stepped and the rigging completed immediately, and the vessel, it is expected, will be ready for her owner within two or three weeks.\n\nThe Morna has a draught of eight feet, and should displace about 30 tons.  \n</blockquote>\nSMH Friday 29/8/1913 p.7 - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15446332\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15446332</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8656379411-72157633262564539", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8656379411/#comment72157633267193818", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1366189279", "_content": "MORNA is still floating around at Neutral Bay - <a href=\"http://www.sail-world.com/Australia/index.cfm?SEID=2&amp;Nid=40313&amp;SRCID=0&amp;ntid=0&amp;tickeruid=0&amp;tickerCID=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sail-world.com/Australia/index.cfm?SEID=2&amp;Nid=403...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8656379411-72157633267193818", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8656379411/#comment72157633267646573", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1366241235", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Thank you for the info BC.
