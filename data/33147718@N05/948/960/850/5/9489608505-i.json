Count von Luckner was famous for his physical strength, which he would often demonstrate by bending pennies with his fingers and tearing telephone books in half. It appears that von Luckner and the man on his right are holding pennies and posing for the camera. On 4 June 1938, Brisbane's 'The Courier-Mail' included the following report on page 1:\n\n'CANBERRA, Friday \u2014 Count, von Luckner, the man who tears thick telephone books in halves with ease, played one of his favourite tricks when he called on the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) to-day. He bent a penny with his fingers!\n\nSubsequently he presented it to Mr Lyons, saying he hoped it would be a lucky penny for Australia. Unlike &quot;Popeye,&quot; he does not ascribe his strength to eating spinach. 'I live simple and eat primitive,' he explained to-day ...\n\nIncidentally, telephone books were a live topic in Canberra to-day. In the party room to-day Mr Mahoney, the genial Labour member for Denison, found a great pile of Melbourne telephone directories on his desk \u2014 all torn across. On top was a message, &quot;With Count von Luckner's compliments.&quot; &quot;Countess von Luckner's compliments&quot; were presented on top of a smaller pile nearby. &quot;What wrists they must have,&quot; said Mr. Mahoney, while his colleagues had difficulty In keeping straight faces. Some of them had torn up the telephone books for Mr. Mahoney's benefit, for he was the member who asked a question in the House of Representatives this week about the reported destruction of Commonwealth property.'\n\nFor more information on Count von Luckner's visit see our blog post <a href=\"http://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/10/25/the-sea-devil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">'Espionage and paranoia: The Sea Devil tours Australia'</a>.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J.
