Thank you for pointing us to the text. Initial research lead us to believe the image depicted Bery Sidney Haynes. However, this photograph is too early to be her, so it appears that it depicts the theatre actress Beryl Sidney. We are currently researching Sidney and hope to find out more information, especially about this particular event that took place on SS MOLDAVIA II. \nThank you again from the curatorial staff at the Australian National Maritime Museum.", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-3346131070-72157630321814848", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3346131070"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682460}
