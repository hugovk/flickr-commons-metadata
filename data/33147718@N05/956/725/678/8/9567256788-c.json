Co. liner Takada is making a single voyage to Australia with a cargo of linseed and general cargo from India. Yesterday as she lay at Ocean Steamers' Wharf the liner's broad passenger decks were deserted, the alleyways were quiet and empty, all of tbe cabins were locked and tbe public rooms were bare and comfortless. An old passenger certificate hanging in a frame on the wall near the dining saloon showed that in her day, when she was one of the crack ships of the company's fleet, she carried 50 first class passengers and 52 second class, with a crew of 157.\n\nThe Takada is a sister ship to the steamer Tanda, one of the best-known ships on the Australian coast, which runs from Melbourne to China and Japan in the E. and A. line's passenger service. Both ships were built for the B.I.S.N. Co. by Alexander Stephen and Sons, Ltd., of Glasgow, in 1914.. The Tanda was transferred from the B.I. Company to the Eastern and Australian Steamship Co. soon after she was launched. Within a few weeks or the outbreak of the war both the Tanda and the Takada were converted to hospital ships. The Tanda was chartered by the residents of Madras and given to the Indian Government for use as a hospital ship, and the Takada was sent to Mesopotamia to bring back wounded troops to Bombay, making occasional visits to South Africa, re-patriating wounded men from that Dominion. After the war the Takada was returned to the B.I. Company and placed in the Far East service. Because of her age she was withdrawn, about 12 months ago, stripped of all the fittings in the passenger accommodation, and laid up in Bombay pending her sale. Then freights rose sharply and conditions improved to such an extent that the Takada was recommissioned at a cargo ship. The future of the ship is now uncertain, but It is understood that as soon as the B.I. Company is able to take delivery of new tonnage which it has on order in Great Britain the old liner will be sold. ... ...\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/36378757\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/36378757</a>\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-9567256788-72157635218275895", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/9567256788/#comment72157635218295961", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1377422273", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons] You have several photos of people on the sister ship TANDA - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=33147718@N05&amp;q=tanda\">www.flickr.com/search/?w=33147718@N05&amp;q=tanda</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-9567256788-72157635218295961", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/9567256788/#comment72157635224791468", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1377423076", "_content": "The ship-builder's model of the ABERSEA  under its previous name SOUTH BULLI, is now in the Powerhouse Museum  with a good history, a &quot;60-miler&quot; for 53 years, - <a href=\"http://from.ph/210424\" rel=\"nofollow\">from.ph/210424</a>.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-9567256788-72157635224791468", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/9567256788/#comment72157635228682203", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1377470927", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Yikes wow!
