The caption accompanying the <i>Home</i> pic doesn't exactly make it clear who's who, but it looks like one of the chaps in the vehicle closest the camera is Admiral Robinson...I'd say photographer Sam Hood must have been standing somewhere near  Harold Cazneaux when he took this pic. One of the other <i>Home</i> pics, which shows the procession passing thru the welcome arch, might even include both Hood and Cazneaux...the snappers snapped!\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02/10151340396/]\n\nPS...if this chap below isn't from HMS Pinafore, my alternative theory is he's one of the Admirals who visited Sydney in 1925 with the US Fleet...

We're thinking though, if Cazneaux took the photos then that can't be him in the photo, although it might just be from his studio. Based on our experience with Hera Roberts, it looks like Hood may have done more work for the <em>Home</em>. I'd be interested to see what else pops up over time.
