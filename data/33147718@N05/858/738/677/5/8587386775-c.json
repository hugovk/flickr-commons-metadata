Visitng Sydney in November, 1934,  the visitors and ship received a huge small boat line-up welcome in Farm Cove, and I'm sure you have other Sam Hood photos of that event. Should give you an exact date of their arrival, too. . This photo is one of a number taken from Fort Denison. \n\nHMS SUSSEX remained in Australia on exchange while HMAS AUSTRALIA took the Royal couple back to Britain in early 1935.

The day was perfect for. the welcome. It was a sunny morning, with a thin veil of cloud tempering the warmth, and just enough wind to lift the bunting bravely, to give a sparkle to the blue water of the harbour, and to waft away the smoke lrom the guns firing.\nSCENE IN FARM COVE.\nSydney's favoured approach being by the sea, this was a marine welcome. The. warships coming up the harbour were met by boats of all kinds. People were clustered on the prominent headlands. The city began to fill with people, and the general trend was towards Macquarle-street and the Botanic Gardens. At about, 10 o'clock the crowds became dense everywhere. many people taking up positions in the streets to await the procession. \nFarm Cove was a glorious picture. Verdant grass formed a foreground beyond which was the small while pavilion at the landing place rising above a forest of white staffs in a glitter of colour as the flag fluttered. White yachts were gathered in the bay, behind the two lines forming a lane through which the Royal barge was to travel, and close by were the naval vessels, in all their majesty and imposing might, with sailors landing in llnes on the decks and offlcers in cocked hats moving about. Yachts flecked the picture as they moved among the big grey ships.\nAt the landing place, the rising ground, crowded with people among the trees built up a background. The guard of honour was waiting, distinguished personages were at the reception platform, bands played at intervals till half past 10. Then there was a lull. A sense of expectancy came over the scene, and the hubbub of the throng died to a dull murmur. ... ... &quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8587386775-72157635414852502", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8587386775/#comment72157635426112089", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "31324280@N02", "iconserver": "5543", "datecreate": "1378626430", "_content": "Nice to see a result and good info from Kookaburra2011.
