Our vessels curator thinks  the image of BONA also appears in Sydney Sails, it would be great to find the originals. Apparently the BONA in this article is the cutter BONA, as opposed to the schooner BONA (that later became BOOMERANG - confused yet?). The schooner BONA was built in Sydney and taken to Melbourne, while the cutter BONA was racing in Sydney from about 1899. Our yachting expert David thinks there must have been a time in the 1920s when both were in Sydney and the Alberts changed the name of their schooner to BOOMERANG.  (The Alberts also had two BOOMERANGs, one a motor vessel &amp; the other the schooner).
