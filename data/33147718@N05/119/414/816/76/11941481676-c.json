The first Australian troops and their horses sailed in late 1899 and were involved in major action by January 1900. After Australian Federation in 1901, the new Commonwealth Government sent a further eight battalions. \n\n\nI think this is the ship HMAT A7 Medic. She was built in 1899 in Belfast, Ireland and was owned by the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company Ltd, Liverpool (the White Star Line, which operated the Titanic), and leased by the Commonwealth until 26 October 1917. The Medic had also been a key troopship for Australia during the second Boer War. It was eventually sunk by the German U-boat U-608 on 11 September 1942, during World War II.\nSee this link for a small image of the Medic--scroll down:\n <a href=\"http://australis86.angelfire.com/war_records/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">australis86.angelfire.com/war_records/index.html</a>\n\nAlso see this link for detailed info about troop deployments on the Medic--scroll down: <a href=\"http://flotilla-australia.com/hmat.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">flotilla-australia.com/hmat.htm</a>", "authorname": "The Happy Rower", "id": "33142378-11941481676-72157639753380614", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "11941481676"}, "flarchive:created": 1389683296}
