The book 'Sydney Harbour of Yesteryear' by Jeff Toghill is on Hall's photography and has a section describing the glass plate negative equipment of the time. He concludes that Hall was using the early hand held 'detective' cameras on board his launch, supported by the fact that many of the action shots are taken on the smaller half-plate negatives used by these kinds of cameras, rather than the full-plates used in the studio. In 1888 William F Hall submitted an application for an <a href=\"http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=5164103\" rel=\"nofollow\">invention</a>  of a self-levelling stand for cameras. In 1913 there is a Police Gazette record for W J Hall for equipment that 'have been in use for some time' and were stolen including; &quot;a Geortz Anshutz camera, a snapshot camera, plate magazine, and a Circuit camera...'
