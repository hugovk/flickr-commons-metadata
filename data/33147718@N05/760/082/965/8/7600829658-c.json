Some Australian newspapers have her name as 'Kone San' or 'Konasan'...the US newspaper items I've found all have 'Kono San' or 'Konosan'...per the Australian newspaper items, by 1929 she'd  spent 5 years on the Keith vaudeville circuit in the US (which I gather was a US version of JC Williamson)...theatre experts might be able to tell us all about her...was she Japanese or a Japanese-American?

Might have to dig around in the yet to be digitised theatre magazines to find more info on her...note that one US reviewer referred to her as a &quot;Chinese girl&quot;, however her name (and I assume it would have been a stage name) suggests she was Japanese...\n\nJust to wander slightly off track(!)...there were evidently quite a few Chinese and Chinese-American vaudeville stars in the US in the 1920s...eg.
