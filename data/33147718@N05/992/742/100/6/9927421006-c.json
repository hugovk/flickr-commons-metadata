Given the age of the photo that puts it outside Australia, New Zealand, or any of our near neighbours because we and they had pounds, shillings and pence before 1966.  Most likely would be USA or Canada, and we can see some snow on the background mountain. At the bottom of the sign are the words &quot;Douglas&quot; and &quot;Juneau&quot;, so this is either at Juneau, Alaska or Douglas Alaska or within a ferry's journey distance of those 2 places.\nHaving a bit of a look at online images, I see that Juneau was a very busy port in first half of 20th century, and the City of Douglas on Douglas Island was somewhat less busy.  Not much development in the background of this photo, so more likely to be Douglas than Juneau.\nIn 1935 the Juneau to Douglas bridge opened, making ferry travel less of a big thing.  Perhaps that dates this photo image to before 1935, perhaps not.", "authorname": "BobMeade", "id": "33142378-9927421006-72157635869318244", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/9927421006/#comment72157635882799744", "realname": "", "path_alias": "swordscookie", "author": "39191857@N05", "iconserver": "3461", "datecreate": "1380124306", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/lifeasdaddy] Nice work, one can also see the word Treadwell and there was a mine of that name operating in Alaska between 1881 and 1922.
