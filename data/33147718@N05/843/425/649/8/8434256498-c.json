Taken in the Depression era, this and its companion images -  your Object NOs. 00034838 [crane ride] and Object No. 0034839 [slippery slide] - are just a joy to behold. \n\nNow, CORRECTIONS AND  A MEA CUPLA : forget the round and square wheelhouse windows distinction between HMAS CANBERRA [I] and HMAS AUSTRALIA [II] for a moment - it did not apply until modifications to CANBERRA some time after 1933, and I think you should go back to  your original caption.\n\nThis image is almost certainly HMAS CANBERRA [I] holding her series of children's parties at Garden Island on the weekend of December 12-13 1931, as described in the Sydney Morning Herald articles to which you had links from beachcomberaustralia under Pic Object NO. 00034838, the crane ride image.\n\nNote it is the same crane ride, and the same unusual flag flying above the slippery slide kids entertainment as shown in Pic, Object No. 00034839. \n\nSo, the round and square wheelhouses question. I feel I may be responsible for Bob Meade's perception on this, and I had myself accepted it as a blanket distinction, given to me also by an expert commentator. I've applied it as an identifying distinction many times, but  I now find it did not apply until after some bridge work modernisations on CANBERRA l sometime after 1933. Hence, we'll have to make a number of corrections in our own collections.\n\nReviewed salient points supporting this:\n\n*In their original configurations, both HMAS CANBERRA [I] and HMAS AUSTRALIA [II] arrived in Australia in 1928 and 1929 with the same original and old-fashioned County Class 'ocean liner' look, and both with large square, pretty ugly box-type wheelhouses above the bridge, both with square windows. Evidence: Ross Gillett's 'Australian an d N ew Zealand Warships 1914-1945, p87. \n\n* CANBERRA still had this square wheelhouse with square windows when she was photographed by the celebrated NZ photographer Sydney Charles Smith at Wellington's Kings Wharf in  September 1933, as shown here:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/3908140912/\">www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/3908140912/</a>.  \n\n*Some time between Sept 1933 and 1937 CANBERRA's bridge was modified and modernized, resulting in rounded wings above the wheelhouse at the Director Tower level,  and round portholes or scuttles in the wheelhouse structure, in place of the square windows there previously. From this point on she is distinguishable from HMAS AUSTRALIA [II]. Source for this 1937 dating, pics shown in John Bastock's authoritative but limited edition book 'Australia's Ships of War' [Angus and Robertson, Sydney 1975] page 106, particularly the Allan C. Green image in the middle of that page. .\n\nHence, from 1937, CANBERRA [I] looked like this, with round scuttles in her wheelhouse...\n\n <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/5491719366/\">www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/5491719366/</a>\n\nSorry again for any confusion caused. Warships are continually modified, and tracking those changes in photographs can be a continual process. Glad if anyone can more precisely date CANBERRA's bridge modifications in the 1930s -  standard book references and online sources don't seem to have it.\n\nConcluding: I now feel certain this photo shows CANBERRA doing the publicized childrens christmas parties in mid-December 1931, same as the companion images, and as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald. \n\nOh, in the background here are a Modified Town Class Cruiser,  probably HMAS BRISBANE [I], in reserve and being stripped, and a Flower Class survey/sloop ex-mineswseeper, probably HMAS GERANIUM, also in reserve, the smaller vessel alongside the cruiser.", "authorname": "Kookaburra2011", "id": "33142378-8434256498-72157632696862781", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8434256498/#comment72157632699364005", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1360160857", "_content": "Here's HMAS Canberra in Cockatoo Island dock January 1934 <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17040876\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17040876</a> ; at Adelaide March 1934 (different bridge) ; at sea April 1934 (?different bridge) <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92351292\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92351292</a> ; at Fremantle in September 1934 (?different bridge)  <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32954429\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32954429</a> ; at Fremantle again in October 1935 (different bridge) <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85732191\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85732191</a>;\n\nAll up I'm voting for HMAS Australia, 6th or 7th December 1930, per the SMH reports of the 1930 children's parties <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16736735\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16736735</a> ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16736812\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16736812</a> .

Having said that, you could argue that this is a less convincing piece of evidence, as identifying people is often such an unreliable way of dating/labelling photographs.\n\nThis particular photograph, on the other hand, should be labelled HMAS <em>Australia</em> or <em>Canberra</em> 1930(?) - 1938...because we cannot be certain it was the same event or that it was one vessel or the other. Although, [http://www.flickr.com/photos/41311545@N05/] certainly does offer some interesting arguments, suggesting that this particular image, as separate from the others, possibly depicts <em>Canberra</em> in 1931. It gets pretty confusing!\n\nBy the way, welcome to the discussion sailorsam4!", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-8434256498-72157632744147599", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8434256498/#comment72157632749742742", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1360637849", "_content": "Just going on what we see...I'd say that the pic of the children in the crane basket was taken in December 1930...assuming that Sam Hood didn't do a bit of post production and photoshop the December 1930 Harbour Bridge into the pic. Beyond this, I'm not at all certain of anything...I'm speculating and assuming...I'd be surprised if the pic of the children on the slippery slide wasn't taken on the same occasion...mainly because the children we see in the crane basket appear to be the same crowd...but of course this is the pic which carries the inscription 'HMAS Canberra, December 1931' (though the issue re who wrote the inscription and when might be something worth exploring)...the third pic might well have been taken on a different occasion...though the fact that we see the elephant flag in pics 2 &amp; 3 is interesting...I haven't yet abandoned hope that we might be able to track down a newspaper item in a yet to be digitised newspaper which might enable us to be more definite...there's also the possibility that other photos might yet turn up in the various collections which will be helpful...though sometimes other pics might also open up new cans of worms...eg <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7653426404/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/7653426404/</a> ...all up this puzzle is quite fascinating...but I've put it in my too hard basket for the time being!\n\nJust for interest, here's a great pic of HMAS Australia in the Sutherland Dock in January 1929... <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_rRVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1524,1044305\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.google.com/newspapers?id=_rRVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LJYDA...</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-8434256498-72157632749742742", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8434256498/#comment72157632755586252", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1360705222", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] We had considered that prospect, otherwise how can we explain the anachronism?

I commented earlier saying the ship was 'Canberra,' mistakenly thinking it was flag ship at that time. I have [after much detailed study] detected a unique, tell-tale structural clue which tells me this ship is HMAS Australia, and with the Rear Admiral's flag (Evans) at the masthead it would most likely be circa 1930. The ship at the rear would have to be 'Geranium'.
