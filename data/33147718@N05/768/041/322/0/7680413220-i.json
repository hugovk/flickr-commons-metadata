The photograph was taken when she was 16.\n\nThis image is part of an archive series consisting of photographs relating to the career of champion Australian swimmer, diver and vaudeville entertainer in Australia and the United Kingdom Beatrice Kerr. The photographs depict Kerr diving and posing in swimsuits, a ange of swimming pools or piers, and feature her family and acquaintances.\n\nBeatrice Maude Kerr (like rival Annette Kellerman and contemporaries Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie) was an exemplar of the fit modern woman in the early 1900s at a time when the physical culture movement was growing. In particular the sport of swimming was becoming very popular, yet it was still a novelty in many communities in Australia, North America and in the UK where Kerr subsequently toured demonstrating her prowess. \n\nKerr had a fastest swimming time of 1 minute 21.4 seconds for the 100 yards (91.4 m) and 27.5 minutes for the mile (1.6 km). Although Kerr did not hold world records or swim at the Olympics like Fanny Durack and Mina Wylie she was highly regarded as a swimmer and entertainer and inspired many young women to take to the water.\n\nThe Australian National Maritime Museum undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
