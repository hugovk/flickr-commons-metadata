In regards to whether it is arriving or departing, could go either way! Due to it\u2019s trimming being just a bit high in the bows (see waterline position), maybe the coal supplies are down, in which case its coming in. Gangways are out (but could be being stowed) and there is loose cargo at the edge of the wharf which would suggest it is there to be loaded - however none of this answers the question with certainty! The educated guess from the folks here is that the vessel is arriving which may make it 7 March 1908.", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-7737352814-72157631044469950", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7737352814/#comment72157631046776338", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1344857819", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons] Fascinating stuff!", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-7737352814-72157631046776338", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7737352814"}, "flarchive:created": 1389680785}
