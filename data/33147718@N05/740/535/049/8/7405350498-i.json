In 1903, the 'Australian Town and Country Journal' reported that the 'old mill', affectionately christened the 'one of the lions of the Hawkesbury', was situated halfway between Windsor and Peat's Ferry, 'in one of the most picturesque reaches of the river.' It was used to 'ground wheat and maize...until the great flood of 1867' which caused extensive damage. Despite it falling into disuse, much of its 'antiquated machinery' still existed when this article was published. It was even said to have been haunted and it remained a tourist attraction until it was demolished in the early 1900s.\n\nThe Hall collection provides an important pictorial record of recreational boating in Sydney Harbour, from the 1890s to the 1930s \u2013 from large racing and cruising yachts, to the many and varied skiffs jostling on the harbour, to the new phenomenon of motor boating in the early twentieth century. The collection also includes images of the many spectators and crowds who followed the sailing races.\n\nThis image belongs to a series of photographs probably taken on the Hawkesbury River by William Frederick Hall between 1880 and 1909.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly.\n\nObject no. 00002335"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1380", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1900-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382915388", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1340159765"}, "originalsecret": "8b8acf2cae", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7092", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7405350498/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389681432}
