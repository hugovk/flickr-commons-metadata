How dreadful that you did not get my Flickr mail of 9/10/12 - you must think me terribly rude!\n\nCopied here -\n\nBIG THANK YOU ...\n\nDear Penny, Nicole and the ANMM Curatorial Team,\n\nMany thanks for sending the wonderful 100 Stories book; it was very kind of you all (especially signing it), and I am already enjoying reading it. And the charming card is of great interest because an uncle used to pilot for BEA including Malta. What a generous thought and much appreciated. I do enjoy your Flickr postings and my 2 cents might add up to something one day.\n\nCoincidently I have just started volunteer work as a watchkeeper at the Mid North Coast Maritime Museum here in Port Macquarie. The AMAZING thing is that they allowed Google Street View INSIDE the two Pilot's Cottages, and anyone can have a sticky-beak. I am not sure if this is a first for a museum or not. Here is the link - x , or just search in GoogleMaps for &quot;mid north coast maritime museum&quot; and click on the photo at left. Google are coming to your home next ... !\n\nAgain, many thanks for the book - it is a lovely gift.\n\nBest wishes to you all, and keep posting on Flickr.\n\nM a r k \nbeachcomberaustralia \n\n&quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-7404358560-72157632064990018", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7404358560/#comment72157632060965377", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1353482257", "_content": "I think I might have the answer  ...  my previous messages had a shortened googleMaps hyperlink which Flickr normally rejects with a warning,  ... but there was no warning so the mail was not sent.\n\nClear as mud!", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-7404358560-72157632060965377", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7404358560/#comment72157632070501508", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1353539281", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Thank YOU Beachcomber!
