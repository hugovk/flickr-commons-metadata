It is possible that she is American shipowner, Captain Edward Robert Sterling's, first daughter Ethel Manila Sterling. Ethel Manila Sterling was born on 20 February 1895 (or 1897) in Manila, the Philippines. She married Harry T Kelsh Junior and, according to the 1920 US census, she was 23 and he was 30 years old at the time. Listed as a housewife, this information was crossed out and replaced with the word \u2018none\u2019. Her husband Harry was born in Pennsylvania and served as a commissioned officer in the US Coast and Geodetic Survey from April 1911 to September 1917, and as 1st lieutenant in the Air Service from that time until December 1918. By 1930 US Census, he was working in finance in the banking industry.\n\nFor more information see our blog post on the Sterlings: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/OsqaFc\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/OsqaFc</a>\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J.
