Basil served with several companies such as Howard Smith, but worked mainly in the employ of Burns Philp. During the course of his career Basil relocated to Rabaul with his family and during WWII he assisted with the evacuation of a large number of expatriates in his ship MULIAMA. On returning to Australia Basil applied to join the Queensland Coast and Torres Strait Pilot Service, membership of which carries great prestige. Possessing a thorough knowledge of the navigation of Australia\u2019s east coast, Helm was accepted in October 1942. After the war, Basil continued in the Torres Strait Pilot Service until he resigned in 1954 to make a new life as a grazier, at a property named 'Jillamatong' near Braidwood in New South Wales.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. \n\nObject no.
