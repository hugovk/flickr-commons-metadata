A young woman in a neck-to-knee bathing costume stands watching at the edge of the surf.\nThis image is part of a collection of photos by Harry Brisbane Williams. \n\nThe Williams photographic collection provides an interesting record of a range of activities on Sydney Harbour from the 1890s into the 1920s. An enthusiastic amateur boater and photographer, Williams\u2019 photographs capture a range of subjects \u2013 pleasure cruising on his motor launch on the Lane Cove River, yachting on Sydney Harbour, foreshore social activities, surf lifesaving, cargo ships, battle cruisers of the United States fleet, model yachting and the shipbuilding industry. In particular, they are a wonderful personal record of the new phenomenon of leisure motor boating in the early twentieth century.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly. \n\nObject number: 00017040\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1837", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1900-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1343631026", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1343370428"}, "originalsecret": "55b50a69a4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7266", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7654769146/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389680885}
