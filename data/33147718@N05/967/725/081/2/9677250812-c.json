I'd say there's a chance this might be Myrtle Glass (1897-1945), an American vaudeville entertainer who visited Australia in 1928 with her husband co-star Jimmy Conlin...if you look at this vid, you might initially think the Hall pic can't possibly be Myrtle Glass...but check out the couple of moments in the vid when we get a closer front on view of her...at 1.07...1.14...3.57...4.08...8.10...8.18... Just going on the vid, I'm not anywhere near 100% convinced it's her...but I'd say she's definitely a candidate. There's evidently footage of a couple of other Conlin &amp; Glass acts in existence...maybe they might be more helpful...don't think they've been digitised yet.\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/vitaphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs.indiewire.com/leonardmaltin/vitaphone</a> ...or there's this still...", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-9677250812-72157639307066636", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "9677250812"}, "flarchive:created": 1389618360}
