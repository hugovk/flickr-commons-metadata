The squadron consisted of the IWATE, ASAMA and YAKUMO. Nearly 2,500 men of which 300 were midshipmen spent time in Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth during their tour. A contingent from the squadron are shown here at the Millions Club on Rowe St in Sydney. Admiral Saito and some of his fellow naval officers were invited by the Australian-Japanese Society to attend a luncheon.\n\nThe Millions Club was established by local businessmen in the belief that accelerated British migration would make Sydney the first Australian city to reach a population of one million. The Founding President Sir Arthur Rickard, a local real estate developer was a strong advocate of British migration, yet was also President of the Japan-Australia Society. Whilst he considered the Japanese to be unsuitable immigrants, he admired their social welfare system and ambition of the nation.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J. Hood Studio collection. Sam Hood (1872-1953) was a Sydney photographer with a passion for ships. His 60-year career spanned the romantic age of sail and two world wars. The photos in the collection were taken mainly in Sydney and Newcastle during the first half of the 20th century. \n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
