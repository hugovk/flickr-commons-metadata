I just returned from Germany after living there for over 30 years. I was honored to be able to print a manuscript from the handwritten notes of my father-in-law (Eduard Matheisen), ship's captain for many years. He served on the &quot;Eilbek&quot; from 1909-11. If interested, I would send you the passage (sorry, in German). His stories are very interesting and perhaps the other ships he sailed on would maybe help you.\nEd Molloy", "authorname": "edmolloysr", "id": "33142378-3307493541-72157622912605033", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/3307493541/#comment72157624117292817", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1276131186", "_content": "Hi Ed,\n\nmany thanks for this.
