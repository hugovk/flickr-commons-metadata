Several of these ships had two funnels and had long names; the single funnel ships were named after generals and rivers and had short names. This vessel has a single funnel and a long name - I'm still working on its identity.\nI wonder if the tug in this Sydney photo is the Waratah of 1902, now a museum ship? \nSome guesswork here.", "authorname": "FredV45", "id": "33142378-6837360688-72157629500057170", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6837360688"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682134}
