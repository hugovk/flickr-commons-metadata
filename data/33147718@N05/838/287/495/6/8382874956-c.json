According to the official inquiry, the loss of that ship was most likely due to a catastrophic structural failure of the hull which caused her to momentarily break in two. The star and two bands on the funnels of both ships look identical, indicating that they belonged to the same line, and the names are very similar. Anyway, it looks like the&quot;Anglo-Canadian&quot; was luckier than her possible sister.", "authorname": "Szymek S.", "id": "33142378-8382874956-72157632528131057", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8382874956/#comment72157632538175239", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1358387730", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/maciupelis] Wow great info thanks!
