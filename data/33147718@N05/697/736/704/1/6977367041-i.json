The mounted photograph was taken by Hall &amp; Co. depicts a Sydney Rowing Club dinner. The dinner was held at the ABC rooms on 14 December 1907.\n\nSydney Rowing Club is the oldest Rowing Club in New South Wales and was founded in 1870. It was originally situated at East Circular Quay but heavy water traffic necessitated a move to Woolloomooloo in 1889 and then to Abbotsford on the Parramatta River.\n\nAustralia first sent rowers to Stockholm 1912. The eight won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Regatta en route to Sweden. A change of personnel between Henley and Stockholm resulted in the crew losing some form and it missed a medal, whilst the Leander crew, which finished second at Henley, won the gold medal for Great Britain.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection.
