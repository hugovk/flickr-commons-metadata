We do have a Hall image of spectators on Clark Island similar to the one in Sydney Mail 24 Feb 1926 with a four masted ship in the background, but the media file is very low res so will have to get back to you on that one! It can get a little confusing re the emblems on the mainsail as many vessels used the same symbols (sometimes in different colours - which obv isn't clear in B&amp;W).", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-6984887818-72157632911836574", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/6984887818/#comment72157632907840767", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1362372655", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] I do wonder though, if (as a famed livestock and animal photographer) Mr Hall was also at the dog show?!\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8526242763/\" title=\"Three dogs leashed together by Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8526242763_5729ef4c92_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"69\" alt=\"Three dogs leashed together\" /></a>", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-6984887818-72157632907840767", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "6984887818"}, "flarchive:created": 1389681950}
