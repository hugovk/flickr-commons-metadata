It was designed as a seaplane carrier and built at Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour in 1928. It could carry nine seaplanes but in service handled only six, which were lifted off and onto the ship by a large crane. In 1936 a catapult was fitted but was probably never used, as soon thereafter the ship was sent to England as part-payment for a more useful Royal Navy cruiser which was renamed &quot;HMAS Hobart&quot;. Albatross served with honour and some damage during WW2 and was then laid up, only to be sold in 1947. It was renamed &quot;Pride of Torquay&quot; and rebuilt to carry refugees and migrants as the &quot;Hellenic Prince&quot; - back to Australia. This rather ungainly but colourful ship was dismantled in 1954.", "authorname": "FredV45", "id": "33142378-3364259950-72157617375833736", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/3364259950/#comment72157625185009883", "realname": "Roger", "path_alias": null, "author": "49015875@N00", "iconserver": "162", "datecreate": "1288864026", "_content": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Torrens_%28D67%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Torrens_%28D67%29</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Albatross_%281928%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS_Albatross_%281928%29</a>", "authorname": "victuallers2", "id": "33142378-3364259950-72157625185009883", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "3364259950"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682448}
