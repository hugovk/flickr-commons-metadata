We've run this one by our vessels curator too who says&quot;\n\n&quot;The smaller skiff with the spinnaker up has a rather bendy mast, but it is not broken.  Its hard to see if they have yet to secure the halyard that pulled the spinnaker up, it should be  tied off toward the stern of the skiff, which would then support the mast better, it looks unsupported and thus is bending ( a lot!). The spinnaker is set correctly, the panels ran up and down the sail in those days.&quot;\n\nI hope that is of assistance :)", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-8055207191-72157633193112176", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8055207191/#comment72157633204736978", "realname": "Bruce Turnbull", "path_alias": "saltypix", "author": "50085758@N07", "iconserver": "3351", "datecreate": "1365510568", "_content": "Thanks for the feedback.
