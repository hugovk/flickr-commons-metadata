This particular man is wearing the white trousers and shoes particular to the Zouaves.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s William J Hall collection. The Hall collection provides an important pictorial record of recreational boating in Sydney Harbour, from  the 1890s to the 1930s \u2013 from large racing and cruising yachts, to the many and varied skiffs jostling on the harbour, to the new phenomenon of motor boating in the early twentieth century. The collection also includes images of the many spectators and crowds who followed the sailing races.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly.\n\nObject no. 00002406"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1158", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2004-02-10 13:19:19", "lastupdate": "1351024435", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1340065408"}, "originalsecret": "c07676a766", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8167", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7397928574/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389681452}
