This image depicts the foreshore parkland area. In the background, a whale's jawbones are visible and form an archway. The jawbones originally came from a whaling station at Twofold Bay, on the south coast of New South Wales. The flagpole was salvaged from the collier BELLAMBI.\n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J. Hood Studio collection.
