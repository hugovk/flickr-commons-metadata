Enough to make a film. \nFrom <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Sealark_(1903)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a> - \n\n<blockquote>\n&quot;  Initially launched in 1887 as a private yacht by Robert Steele and Co., Greenock for Charles Joseph Lambert and named SS Wanderer. She was registered as a yacht of the Royal Yacht Squadron and became known as RYS Wanderer and was based at Cowes, Isle of Wight. After undertaking a number of cruises around the world, she was sold and was renamed Vagus. American millionaire William Kissam Vanderbilt bought the ship in 1900 and she was named as Consuelo.\nIn 1903, she was purchased by the Royal Navy and initially commissioned as HMS Investigator. In 1904 after refitting as a survey vessel, at a cost of \u00a320,000 she was renamed HMS Sea Lark and sailed from Portsmouth in September 1904 to serve with the China Station. In 1910, she sailed from Penang for the Australia Station.[3] She undertook various hydrographic survey work around Australia and the South Pacific between 1910 and 1914. With the beginning of World War I, and the threat of German Empire expansion in the South Pacific, she sailed to Suva, Fiji with a cargo of coastal guns, for a gun emplacement on a hill in Suva.\nAfter returning from Fiji via New Zealand, to Sydney she was paid off in 1914. In 1919, she was purchased by Captain J. H. Patrick for \u00a32500 and converted into a merchant ship at a cost of \u00a315,000 and renamed Norwest. After plying the interstate trade for James Patrick Steamships Ltd up until 1924, she was seized by the English, Scottish and Australian Bank to repay debts owed. After James Patrick Steamships Ltd failed, she was sold by the bank to William Waugh Ltd., Balmain, Sydney for about \u00a3500 where she was dismantled and converted into a hulk.  &quot;\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8292089099-72157632302236786", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292089099/#comment72157632302265260", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1356081193", "_content": "The Wikipedia article references this SMH article of 31/12/1924 p.12 -  <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16205818\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16205818</a> - but disagrees over the early history.  \n\nThe State Library of Victoria has a great earlier hi-res photo of the SEALARK III - <a href=\"http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/29037\" rel=\"nofollow\">handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/29037</a>, same photo in the AWM <a href=\"http://cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/302272\" rel=\"nofollow\">cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/302272</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8292089099-72157632302265260", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292089099/#comment72157632428796390", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1357257545", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "33142378-8292089099-72157632428796390", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292089099/#comment72157632525644446", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1358203850", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Great stuff!
