A bit of Troving reveals that Mr Samuel Hordern and family were on board and were given an enormous send-off, including special FAIRLIGHT and MANLY ferries (with the photographer on board?), the Parramatta steamer PHEASANT (seen alongside here?), the Enterprise Brass Band,  etc etc.  What fun!\n\nFull report in SMH 15/2/1897 p.4 Col.6 -&quot;Farewell to Mr Samuel Hordern&quot; -  <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14088801\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/14088801</a>  Worth quoting -\n\n<blockquote>\n&quot; ... FAREWELL TO MR. SAMUEL HORDERN.\u2014On\nSaturday afternoon a successful send-off was\naccorded to Mr. Samuel Hordern, who, with his\nfamily, left by the P. and O. mail steamship\nChina on a trip to Europe which will probably\nextend over about seven months. Many of the\nemployees of Mr. Hordern's extensive establish-\nment went down to the wharf to await the de-\nparture of the boat, while others secured a posi-\ntion among the crowd on the adjacent point, while\nnot a few took advantage of the special 4 o'clock\ntrips of the Fairlight and Manly, to accompany\nthe China as far as the Heads. The managers of\nthe various departments of Mr. Hordern's em-\nporium chartered the Parramatta steamer\nPheasant (Captain Mance) for the occasion, and\na large company assembled on board before 2\np.m., including Messrs. J. Lumsden (principal    \nmanager), T. T. May (general business manager),\nH. J. Barlett, C. H. Catley, D. Curtin, and T.  \nCaddy. Mr. H. T. Everett, as secretary to the      \ndemonstration, carried out the necessary arrange-\nments satisfactorily, and ample refreshments were\nprovided by Mr. T. W. Helmore, of the Masonic\nHall. The Enterprise Brass Band, which had  \nalso been engaged, provided music during the\nafternoon. Leaving the Floating Jetty at 2 o'clock\nthe Pheasant ran down as far as Watson's Bay,    \nand thence back to Balmain, and steamed up to\nthe China just as the anchor was being weighed\nand the Commodore was towing the liner into\nposition for a start. As the floating village\nmoved slowly ahead past Macquarie Point, the\nPheasant's passengers gave three hearty cheers,  \nthe band playing &quot; Say Au Revoir, but not Good-\nbye.&quot; Mr. Hordern waved his acknowledgments,      \nand then the members of the band and the em-\nployees on the Pheasant vied with each other in    \na vigorous rendering of &quot; For He's a Jolly Good\nFellow.&quot; Between Bradley's and Watson's  \nBay many yachts, centreboards, and other\nsailing craft were passed, and the China was soon\nbetween the Heads and gracefully bowing to the  \nlong swell of the ocean. The Pheasant, with a\ngood press of steam, managed to keep well abreast\nof the vessel, and, possibly by way of encour-\nagement to the homeward-bound voyagers, &quot; A  \nLife on the Ocean Wave &quot; was given. &quot; Auld\nLang Syne &quot; was subsequently sung with hearty        \ngoodwill, and the China went full speed ahead\non her course, speedily leaving her diminutive\nescort behind. ... &quot;\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8292113725-72157632298534505", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292113725/#comment72157632302530438", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1356084874", "_content": "And another quote from the same article -\n\n<blockquote>\n&quot;... DEPARTURE OF THE R.M.S. CHINA,\u2014Saturday\nwas a gala day at the Circular Quay. The afternoon  \nwas beautifully fine, and the novelty of seeing\nthe magnificent passenger steamer China leave for\nthe old country attracted a crowd that exceeded\nanything ever seen before on a mailboat sailing day.        \nNot only was the eastern side of the quay a con-  \ntinuous stream of traffic, but on Fort Macquarie\nPoint there were scores of private carriages and\nbuggies, each with from two to half a dozen\noccupants. Such a scene has rarely, if ever, been\nwitnessed there, even in the old days when, to see\na regatta, people would congregate in thousands.\nThe pride of the P. and O. line looked exceedingly\nhandsome. She is a stately ship, and well de-\nserved all the expressions of admiration passed  \nupon her. Leaving the quay she was drawing\n24ft. forward and about a foot more aft, but even\nat that draught her appearance was light.\nShe loads down close to 30ft. when    \nat an extreme, so that it can easily be imagined\nhow her gracefully modelled hull would lift itself    \nabove the water line, and in the trim she left she\ncertainly presented a grand sight. It was just 4    \no'clock when she got away, followed\nby several steamers crowded with friends    \nof those on board, some of them giving\na &quot; cock-a-doodle &quot; on the road down,  \nbands playing, and every one of the escorting\nsteamers a perfect blaze of handkerchief-waving.  \nA prettier sight or more enthusiastic send-off was  \nnever accorded a liner. Yesterday a wire from\nGabo gives her as passing at 7.30 a.m., a speed of      \nnearly 17 knots. She is on her way to Hobart.  ... &quot;\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8292113725-72157632302530438", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292113725/#comment72157632299286343", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1356093731", "_content": "<a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hordern-samuel-3916\" rel=\"nofollow\">adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hordern-samuel-3916</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "33142378-8292113725-72157632299286343", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292113725/#comment72157632306381348", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1356123867", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pellethepoet] Thanks for the right Samuel Hordern - I had trouble finding his bio.", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8292113725-72157632306381348", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292113725/#comment72157632311089715", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1356209682", "_content": "Full description of the CHINA's features - including mention of gun platforms and possible use as an armed cruiser - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/9391608\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/9391608</a> .", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8292113725-72157632311089715", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292113725/#comment72157632326692267", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1356359267", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "33142378-8292113725-72157632326692267", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8292113725/#comment72157632405848957", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1357096938", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Thanks Beachcomber, wonderful amount of details - as usual :) Fascinating about the Hordern family.
