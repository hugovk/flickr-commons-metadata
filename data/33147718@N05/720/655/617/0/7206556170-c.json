I've just this week dispatched a couple of experts from out Moggill way on what I now realise is a goose chase! My apologies experts! ...I initially thought this pic might have been taken opposite the junction of the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers...but the more I looked (via various pics on Flickr, Google street view, etc) the more I realised things didn't stack up...and the Teviot Range doesn't quite have this profile from out that way either...I feel like a complete goose!\n\n...anyway, after further digging around...I've discovered that this is a companion to another Poulsen pic titled 'SB Cemetery &amp; Fairfield', which also happens to be in the ANMM collection...though not yet on Flickr...With so much water around, apart from the Teviot Range peaks, which we see on the horizon, I can't make head nor tail of what we see here...I can't tell river from flood water, let alone find any familiar landmarks...I thought I might be able to walk around Highate Hill and Dutton Park and with a bit of luck find the spot where this pic was taken...but 120 years on, I've discovered this mightn't possible...I haven't completely given up hope, but during my first excursion I found there are way too many houses and trees around which block the view...regardless, it would be good to have the companion Poulson pic also up on Flickr if that were possible...it shows the view next frame to the left.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-7206556170-72157634718778746", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/7206556170/#comment72157634739185893", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1374476755", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] No problem!
