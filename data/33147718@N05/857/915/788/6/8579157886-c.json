MacMillan &amp; Son, Dumbarton. Dimensions 83,82 \u00d7 12,85 \u00d7 7,31 m [275\u00b40\u00b4\u00b4\u00d7422\u00b4\u00d724\u00b40\u00b4\u00b4] and tonnage 2144 GRT and 1999 NRT. Rigged with skysails and royal sails over double top and single topgallant sails. \n\nOn May 5th, 1913, Captain Bousfield wired the owners to get a tug to tow the ship against the strong head wind, after having received orders for Lim[e]rick. She stranded at the Stag Rocks, Lizard Point, at 08:00 when they tried to get closer to the lighthouse to read the telegraphic answer from the owners. \n\nThis four-masted barque was considered by many to be one of the fastest and most beautiful ships built in the 1890\u00b4s. The ship also had a reputation among seamen for the good treatment her crews received. A.A. Hurst stated than while many ships were attractive, \u00b4\u00b4it was only a few like Black\u00b4s peerless Queen Margaret... that appealed for their looks.\u00b4\u00b4 \n\nSteel hulled, the barque was designed and built by Macmillian of Dumbarton, Scotland in 1893 for John Black and Co. The Queen Margaret made many fine passages for the owners until the fateful day of May 5th., 1913. \n\nOn that day, the captain moved in close to the Lizard (off Cornwall, England), while signaling to owners. Yet another victim of the infamous \u00b4\u00b4Falmouth for orders\u00b4\u00b4 command which sent many ships to their deaths as they closed the treacherous Cornish coast to signal their owners of their arrival. The Lizard, being the Western-most point in England, meant that it was the earliest station at which a captain could signal the owners, in those pre-radio days, of his arrival. \n\nThe owner would then order the ship to the port where the best price could be obtained for the cargo. Standing in to read the signal flags, the captain of the Margaret went too close. The ship struck a rock and stuck fast. Within three days, the masts went, the swelling grain in the hold split the hull and deck wide open and the once stately Queen Margaret became a total loss. What was left of the ship was sold as salvage for a paltry \u00a350.  &quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8579157886-72157633060456872", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8579157886/#comment72157633060526556", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1363948319", "_content": "I wonder if this photo is January 1912 - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15301146\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15301146</a>\n\n&quot; ...
