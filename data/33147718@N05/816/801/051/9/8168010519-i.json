On Christmas Eve 1931 Phar Lap boarded the MONOWAI on which had been specially fitted out with a comfortable stall and exercise yard.  MONOWAI reached San Francisco on January 15, 1932. In March of that year, Phar Lap won the lucrative Agua Caliente Handicap in Mexico, but died the following month from suspected arsenic poisoning. \n\nThis photo is part of the Australian National Maritime Museum\u2019s Samuel J.
