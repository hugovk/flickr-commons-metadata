Many of the insignia were used by multiple boats so it can often be hard to distinguish individual vessels. Our curators have sifted through some of the WJ Hall images &amp; identified where they can. Any input from the public of course is fabulous and perhaps an online index would be possible someday - it would certainly be useful!", "authorname": "Australian National Maritime Museum on The Commons", "id": "33142378-7984239401-72157631553362001", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "7984239401"}, "flarchive:created": 1389680453}
