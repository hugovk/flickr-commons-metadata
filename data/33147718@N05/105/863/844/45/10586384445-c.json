Wild was in the Merchant Navy in WW2 &amp; not part of enlisted forces, so perhaps he was in the reserves? Scrap that - he DID enlist in WW1, his service number is 80307. He didn't get very far though - enlisted (on my Birthday actually) in late September 1918, and joined on 11th October - only 4 weeks before armistice. As far as I can see he was discharged before leaving the recruitment depot.
