This photograph was taken by Frederick Wilkinson while he was travelling on board a ferry to Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney.\n\nHMS DRAGON was a Danae class cruiser of the Royal Navy launched in Glasgow in December 1917. In January 1943 the vessel was transferred to the Polish Navy for further convoy duties and then took part in Operation Neptune as part of the Normandy landings. It was torpedoed and eventually scuttled in 1944.\n\nHMS DUNEDIN was a Danae class light cruiser of the Royal Navy commissioned at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 13 September 1919. During WW2 it was used for searching out German battle cruisers and merchant ships as part of the Northern Patrol, then the West Indies Station and finally the South Atlantic Station. On 24 November 1941 DUNEDIN was sunk after it was hit by torpedoes from the German U-boat  (U-124) off the coast of Brazil. In total 419 men lost their lives; there were only 67 survivors.\n\nFrederick Wilkinson (1901 - 1975) migrated to Australia from England in 1911. While wokring various jobs in and around central Sydney, Wilkinson acquired a camera and began taking photographs of vessels and harbour scenes. Many of his images were used by commercial photographers for souvenir postcards.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly. \n\nPhotographer: Frederick Garner Wilkinson\n\nObject no. 00037701\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1868", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1924-04-09 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1381487513", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1351815685"}, "originalsecret": "89875fe842", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8329", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8146313068/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621113}
