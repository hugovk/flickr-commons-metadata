PORT ALBANY was under the management of the Commonwealth and Dominion Line which was specifically established to operate services from Britain to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSS PORT ALBANY was a 5,714 ton vessel built in 1914, the first of three vessels to bear the name Port Albany. It operated for the Commonwealth and Dominion Line  on the trade route between Australia and London, Britain. In 1929 it was sold to Union Cold Storage Ltd and renamed OREGON STAR.It was scrapped in 1934.\n\nFrederick Wilkinson (1901 - 1975) migrated to Australia from England in 1911. While wokring various jobs in and around central Sydney, Wilkinson acquired a camera and began taking photographs of vessels and harbour scenes. Many of his images were used by commercial photographers for souvenir postcards.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly. \n\nPhotographer: Frederick Garner Wilkinson\n\nObject no. 00040941\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1139", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1923-11-04 16:17:58", "lastupdate": "1351819853", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1351818428"}, "originalsecret": "a6abdf163f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8196", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8146372245/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621105}
