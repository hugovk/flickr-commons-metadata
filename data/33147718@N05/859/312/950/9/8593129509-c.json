I wonder whether maybe some of these pics of Rawhiti involve both Rawhiti I and Rawhiti II...the matter of distinguishing between the two might be quite difficult given both appear to have undergone rebuilds (Rawhiti I in 1910) or at least re-rigs (in the case of Rawhiti II)...my guess is that Rawhiti II might have passed out of circulation after 1922, given the digitised newspaper references to Rawhiti II don't continue beyond this date...one &quot;Arrow&quot; article (digitised but not yet available) indicates Frank Albert sold Rawhiti II in 1922...so maybe the name was then changed again...all up it appears that Rawhiti I and Rawhiti II would have been in circulation together in the period 1913-1922...so I'd say that most of the 1920s (and later) pics of 'Rawhiti' involve Rawhiti I...\n\nHere's the excellent ANMM item on Rawhiti I - <a href=\"http://emuseum.anmm.gov.au/code/emuseum.asp?style=browse&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;page=search&amp;profile=ARHVObjects&amp;searchdesc=HV000019&amp;searchstring=QuickSearch/,/contains/,/HV000019/,/false/,/true&amp;newvalues=1&amp;newstyle=single&amp;newcurrentrecord=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">emuseum.anmm.gov.au/code/emuseum.asp?style=browse&amp;cur...</a> ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14751402\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14751402</a> ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55655196\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55655196</a> ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14734437\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14734437</a> \n\n...Rawhiti I was brought to Australia by Arthur Pittar (evidently Pittar's house at Mona Rd, Darling Point, was also named Rawhiti)...then soon afterwards passed to Charles Brockhoff... <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28144116\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28144116</a> - then in 1909/1910 to Ernest Sayer &amp; Frank Albert...\n\nSMH item on Rawhiti's 1910 refit - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15184072\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15184072</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10764509\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10764509</a> - 1913 Argus pic of the crew of Rawhiti II\n\nThere was also a Rawhiti in Brisbane in the 1920s...but I haven't investigated its DNA...", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-8593129509-72157633102330168", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8593129509/#comment72157633098942957", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1364378989", "_content": "[confused, but watching with interest]\n\nBtw - it it 'Raw hitey' or 'Ra Whitey' or 'RaWhitty' or ... ?", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "33142378-8593129509-72157633098942957", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8593129509/#comment72157633128562318", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1364684110", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "33142378-8593129509-72157633128562318", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8593129509/#comment72157633161534802", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1365030622", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] Hi all, our vessel expert has just said: 'Rawhiti II was a much smaller boat, a 6 metre class yacht about 30 feet long'.\nAnd it also seems that photographs of Rawhiti II are more scarce than the first one.
