The 1920s version featured the Dutch star Beppie de Vries in the title role...the 1930s version featured the English star Sylvia Welling...of the two, Beppie de Vries is perhaps the closest match to the woman we see here...but just going on this SLNSW pic, I'm pretty sure it's not her <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=442750\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=442750</a> . Of all the many possibilities...one is that the woman we see here is in fancy dress costume (!), and that her choice of attire was inspired by 'Madame Pompadour'...though the costume really looks a cut above the average fancy dress outfit...so if my  'Madame Pompadour' guess is a dud...I'd still tend to think that there might be a professional stage connection here...\n\nSimilar backdrop to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8532158815/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8532158815/in/photo...</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8433103969/in/photostream\">www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8433103969/in/photo...</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "33142378-8591676338-72157633094528436", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8591676338/#comment72157633100063628", "realname": "", "path_alias": "anmm_thecommons", "author": "33147718@N05", "iconserver": "3829", "datecreate": "1364336591", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] Thanks for the links - these portraits are tantalising.
