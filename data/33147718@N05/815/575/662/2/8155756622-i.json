RMS NIAGRA was an Ocean liner launched on 17 August 1912 and used for transporting passengers and mail on the trans- Pacific trade route. It was built by John Brown &amp; Company, Clydebank and owned by the Union Steam Ship Company. During World War II NIAGRA was in service with the Canadian-Australasian Line from Auckland, New Zealand, to Suva and Vancouver. It sank on 19 June 1940 after it struck a mine laid by Germans off the north coast of New Zealand. \n\nFrederick Wilkinson (1901 - 1975) migrated to Australia from England in 1911. While working various jobs in and around central Sydney, Wilkinson acquired a camera and began taking photographs of vessels and harbour scenes. Many of his images were used by commercial photographers for souvenir postcards.\n\nThe ANMM undertakes research and accepts public comments that enhance the information we hold about images in our collection. This record has been updated accordingly. \n\nPhotographer: Frederick Garner Wilkinson\n\nObject no. 00041723"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1360", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1924-08-28 14:04:49", "lastupdate": "1376967565", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1352071034"}, "originalsecret": "7c56173a4e", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7112", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/anmm_thecommons/8155756622/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389621070}
