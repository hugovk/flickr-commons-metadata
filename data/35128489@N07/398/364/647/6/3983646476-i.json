Econ, 1939), Margaret Hardiman returned to the School in 1964 to join the Department of Social Science and Administration where, as a lecturer and subsequently a Senior Lecturer, she has been primarily engaged in teaching students from developing countries.  Margaret's knowledge of Third World conditions was particularlt appropriate to her teaching duties on the interdepartmental course for development administrators which she taught together with Peter Dawson and others until 1972.  At the time it was felt that the School's resources could be used effectively to provide more specialist teaching for administrators and development planners concerned with social policy issues in developint countries.  Margaret participated in the discussions on the type of teaching the School could provide and this resulted in the creation of a graduate Diploma Course in Social Planning in Developing Countries in 1973, and an MSc the following year...She has travelled widely in the Third World both to undertake consultantcies and teach, and has done much to promote the social planning courses in her travels.  She taught at the University of Ghana for three years...'
