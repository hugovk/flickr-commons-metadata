Given by Mrs Dora Cleather (nee Tudor).\n\n\n'When Mrs Dora Cleather retires on 31 July 1975, it will be after 44 years' association with the School.  Appointed in 1931, then Dora Tudor, as &quot;a copytypist at the expense of the Rockerfekker Fund&quot;, Eve Evans recorded, &quot;She is a good deal better than we would normally hope to get..,but posts are hard to find...&quot;Promotion soon followed and in 1934 Dora was appointed Private Secretary to Mrs Mair, the Secretary of the School....With the outbreak of war in 1939 Dora went with the School to Cambridge (and quite enjoyed cycling to committee meetings with the minute book in the handlebar basket), and by 1940 was acting as secretary to the Director as well as the Secretary, Walter Adams.  In 1942 Dora married and reigned her post to return to London but was soon giving part-time help on the Library, then still in London, until the birth of her son Anthony, in 1943.  She rejoined the school, now back in Houghton Street, in 1947, working part-time for Professor Robson, but returned as full time Head of the Typing Room in 1954, and since 1967 has been secretary to the Accountant and the Accounts Department...'
