He was educated at Lancing College, and read PPE at Balliol College, Oxford.  He was on the editorial staff of The Economist from 1944 to 1962 and was a Extra-Mural Lecturer of London University from 1944-1949.  He came to the School in 1948 as lecturer in Public Administration and was promoted to a Readership in 1961....He was no ivory-towered academic.  As a Director of Studies at the Civil Service Department he helped to establish the first set of courses at the Civil Service College.  He was a force in the Town and Planning Association and a member of the South East Economic Planning Council...His hobbies were walking (he knew almost every corner of the United Kingdom), golf and making up and telling detective stories.'
