He soon became a leading member of the group of academics gathered round Richard Sayers, from which emerged some of the best contemporary work on monetary institutions both domestic and international.\n\nFrom an early stage the breadth of his interests was evident, and for many years what he wrote in The Observer on Sunday was a major topic for discussion on Monday.  These interests took him to the Treasury for two years; to a period as editor of the National Institute Economic Review, and to membership of official committees on the London Taxicab Trade and Local Government Finance, while for many years he has been a member of the Council of the Consumers Association.  But perhaps his most abiding interest outside the School was in civil aviation; for three years he was a member of the board of the British Airports Authority and later he became Economic Adviser to the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nIn 1979 he was appointed Pro-Director, quite exceptionally he was reappointed for a second term; but to the regret of all his friends and colleagues sudden ill health led to his untimely retirement from the School late in 1983.  Since then, his remarkable recovery has enabled him to resume many of his activities; in particular, he is pursuing a life-long interest in restoring old buildings by devoting much of his time to an eighteenth century manor house in Kent.\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/297\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/297')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1260", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-09-28 14:41:59", "lastupdate": "1379118789", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1254738917"}, "originalsecret": "3197bf577c", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2495", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3982883899/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
