They want no more to make 'em fly.&quot; The case was dismissed.\n\nJack left the court with a clear conscience and an unblemished name among costers; for, although some of them may neglect their wives and families, it seems to be a point of honour with all to treat their donkeys with kindness. For the kindness bestowed the animal invariably shows its gratitude by perfect docility and willingness to bear the yoke imposed by its master. The donkeys fare like their own masters; a prosperous day will secure for them some dainty, or at least a feed without stint, of oats, beans, and hay, at a cost of eightpence or ninepence.&quot;\n\nFor the full story, and other photographs and commentaries, follow this link and click through to the PDF file at the bottom of the description\n<a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=SR+1146\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;i...</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5934", "farm": 8, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-02 16:25:18", "lastupdate": "1373025621", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1323961658"}, "originalsecret": "700734371b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "7163", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/6516045387/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
