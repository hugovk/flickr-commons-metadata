I went to meet Beales in his room, to which be brought the other examiner, Professor Court from Birmingham, but found the room completely bare because the cleaners had been in. Beales collected three chairs from the corridor and we sat in a Kafkaesque trio as they shuffled through the thesis asking me several questions. My replies were stupid becuase I had a bad headache. \n\nShortly after I had withdrawn, Beales came out and said that if, for the purposes of vanity or for getting a job, I wanted to call myself Dr I could now do so. I apologised for my stupid answers but he said 'We all get nerves on these occasions'.\n\nI saw Beales once more when he was giving a lecture in the Old Theatre chaired by the famous historian R H Tawney, a friend of Beales', who fell asleep until Beales woke him. He died at the age of ninety-nine, regretting, I was told by his widow, not to reach a hundred. A great teacher.'\n\nFrom Peter Kingsford's memoirs of his time at LSE, LSE Archives/Small LSE Deposits/157", "authorname": "LSE Library", "id": "35107159-5354510850-72157625821208194", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5354510850"}, "flarchive:created": 1387817148}
