Those big group photos, class of \u201974 or whenever. I suppose there are just too many of us now to get together at one time, departmental away-days capture us in fragments occasionally. \n\nBut it is striking that the collection of individual library staff pictures ends in the early 90\u2019s. It was once part of the staff routine for everyone to have their mugshot taken and for it to be put on public display. When I joined in the late 90\u2019s you would receive a summons to the library office and be positioned sitting up straight in a chair while someone captured you on Polaroid. These were added to display cases for each section fully visible in the public area of the library. The display cases were one of the casualties of the library move to Southampton Buildings and back, I remember seeing the one for our section propped against a wall for a couple of years gradually becoming lost behind boxes of photocopy paper, colleagues moved on, new ones joined us but your old office companions would still be peering at you.\n\nThose Polaroids have long gone now, they didn\u2019t make it to the archives, thankfully I suppose many would say, no chance of being caught frozen in dead fashions or outrageous hairstyles like our predecessors, no enormous glasses or loud shirts to be gawped and giggled at by future colleagues. Though I suppose there may be a tinge of regret as well, as if not being represented in the library pantheon is almost like being written out of history. No chance for a poignant moment with these lost years either when someone you worked with years ago and whom you had forgotten all about suddenly springs back into your memory. Where are they now? Dead maybe, cataloguing in SOAS perhaps, or doing something in software in New Zealand.\n\nPictures will continue to be added, cameras are everywhere now and we can all have thousands of images on our mobiles and PC\u2019s, more than anyone could have imagined back in the big hair-do days, hundreds of these must be lost every time a phone or computer is upgraded, but enough should make it through to flickr to keep the archive alive. But for those lost years? Fallible human memory will have to fill the gap.\n\nCLS", "authorname": "LSE Library", "id": "35107159-4401345066-72157623651108180", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/4401345066/#comment72157623545397965", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "48604637@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1269258500", "_content": "This photo was taking during our annual stockcheck week.
