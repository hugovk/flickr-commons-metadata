Throughout London it is known that all information concerning service in the army can be obtained in this quarter, and intending recruits troop down to this neighbourhood in shoals, converging, as the culminating point of their peregrinations, towards the celebrated public-house at the corner of King Street and Bridge Street. It is under the inappropriate and pacific sign-board of the 'Mitre and Dove' that veteran men of war meet and cajole young aspirants to military honours. Here may be seen\nevery day representatives of our picked regiments.\n[...]\nThe most prominent figure in the accompanying photograph, standing with his back to the Abbey, and nearest to the kerb stone, is that of Sergeant Ison, who is always looked upon with more than ordinary curiosity as the representative of the 6th Dragoon Guards, or Carbineers \u2013 a regiment which of late has been chiefly distinguished for having included in its ranks no less a person than Sir 'Roger Tichborne himself! To the Carbineer's right we have the representatives of two heavy regiments, Sergeant Titswell, of the 5th Dragoon Guards, and Sergeant 'Badcock, of the 2nd Dragoons, or Scots Greys; the latter is leaning against the corner of the public-house. Close to him may be recognized the features of Sergeant Bilton, of the Royal Engineers, while Sergeant Minett, of the 14th Hussars, turns his head towards Sergeant McGilney, of the 6th Dragoons, or Enniskillen, whose stalwart frame occupies the foreground. This group would not, however, have been complete without giving a glimpse at Mr. Cox, the policeman, to whose discretion and pacific interference may be attributed the order which is generally preserved even under the most trying circumstances at the 'Mitre and Dove.'&quot;\n\nFor the full story, and other photographs and commentaries, follow this link and click through to the PDF file at the bottom of the description\n<a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=SR+1146\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;i...</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "8863", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-02 16:38:46", "lastupdate": "1335797436", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1303217234"}, "originalsecret": "2ec993b1e4", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": [{"_content": "Allsopp's ales", "author": "48511485@N06", "h": "51", "authorname": "QuentinUK", "w": "44", "y": "128", "x": "60", "id": "72157626838174039"}, {"_content": "Sergeant Ison, the representative of the 6th Dragoon Guards, or Carbineers", "author": "48511485@N06", "h": "230", "authorname": "QuentinUK", "w": "84", "y": "184", "x": "207", "id": "72157626844408891"}]}, "server": "5107", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/5634667160/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
