We thought originally that this photo was taken while the Library was there, but one of my colleagues who was there pointed out that during this time the whole of the floor space was given over to study spaces. We think now that this photo was taken before LSE Library moved in, while the building was still occupied by the Patent Office. At least that explains why there are no students to be seen (see comments below!)\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/1090\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/1090')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;a...</a>\n\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1625", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-02-09 15:16:18", "lastupdate": "1355846761", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1266226954"}, "originalsecret": "08a6fee263", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4019", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/4358312449/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
