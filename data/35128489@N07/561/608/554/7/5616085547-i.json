In those days vegetables were not only sold here but grew on the spot; and the land, now so valuable, was considered to be worth an annual income of \u00a36 6s. 8d., when given by the Crown to John RusselI, Earl of Bedford, in 1552\u2026\n\n\u2026When death takes one of the group away, a child has generally been\nreared to follow in her parents' footsteps; and the&quot; beat&quot; in front of the church is\nnot merely the property of its present owners, it has been inherited from previous\ngenerations of flower-women. Now and then a stranger makes her appearance,\nprobably during the most profitable season, but as a rule the same women may be\nseen standing on the spot from year' s end to year's end, and the personages of the\nphotograph are well known to nearly all who are connected with the market\u2026\n\nFor the full story, and other photographs and commentaries, follow this link and click through to the PDF file at the bottom of the description\n<a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=SR+1146\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;i...</a> \n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "12100", "farm": 6, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2011-04-02 16:27:44", "lastupdate": "1335797446", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1302708988"}, "originalsecret": "aef0fc6a36", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "5303", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/5616085547/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
