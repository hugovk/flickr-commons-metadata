My guess it that this child was from Viggiano, a small town at the southern-most point of the Italian Apennine range. Viggiano and nearby towns were the 'sending' towns for seasonal itinerant street musicians, whose range gradually extended during the 18th century, from the Italian peninsular, to Europe, England, America, Argentina, Brazil, even Egypt - and finally to the nineteenth-century to Australia. While the British and American press sensationalised the plight of these &quot;little slaves of the harp&quot;, I think that John Thomson and Adelphi Smith were rather more realistic and insightful in their assessment. This child is well dressed and shod, and appears to be well fed. Although he probably left his mother, sisters and younger brothers behind in his home town. He is playing a harp typical of Viggiano; diatonic and portable. The leather strap is for that purpose, and illustrates the famous poem by Paolo Parzanese (1809-1852):\nHo l\u2019arpa al collo , son viggianese\nTutta la terra \u00e8 il mio paese.\nCome la rondine che lascia il nido,\npasso cantando di lido in lido:\ne fin che in seno mi batte il cor\ndir\u00f2 canzoni d\u2019armi e d\u2019amor.\n\nI would be very interested in further comments about the identities of the bystanders - Italian or English? someone with more knowledge than I about costume might be able to help.\n\n(Worth reading: John Zucchi, &quot;Little Slaves of the Harp&quot; and Enzo V.
