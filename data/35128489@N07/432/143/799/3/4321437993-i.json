She started off in the best possible way, working in an academic department, when she was in Government with Professor Robson.  She moved fairly quickly to the Registrar\u2019s Department where she has remained since 1961.\n\nWynn is a graduate of the School, having taken the BSc (Econ) in 1960\u2026.Until Wynn Davis was appointed to the Examinations Office in 1973 all the examinations were handled by Senate House, so the School owes her a real debt of gratitude for the efficient and painstaking way in which she has built up this very important area of academic administration.\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/1063\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/1063')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "905", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-01-27 11:40:08", "lastupdate": "1334104650", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1265024931"}, "originalsecret": "2590f00cbe", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4017", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/4321437993/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387817515}
