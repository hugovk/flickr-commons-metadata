Ormsby on Mr Headicar\n\n'Mr Headicar, the librarian, though not a man of academic disctinction, possessed a memory which enabled him to advise far more learned enquirers in what book, document or pamplet they would find the information they were seeking.  This knowledge was personal to Mr headicar and was not perhaps the most effective guide to the cataloguing but it gave Mr headicar a worldwide reputation as an adviser to researchers.  A popular magazine of the day, discovering this talent published an article referring to Headicar as the 'Napoleon of Librarians' which reflected the awe in which the treasures of of the School Library and of its custodian were held by the uninitiated.'\n\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/1076\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/1076')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "955", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-01-27 12:58:27", "lastupdate": "1362018694", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1265024950"}, "originalsecret": "46b6c7cb09", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4057", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/4321438577/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387817492}
