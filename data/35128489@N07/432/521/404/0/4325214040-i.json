Stern, in the LSE Magazine, June 1979, No57, p.8\n\n'Arthur John (1915-1978) had touched LSE's life at many points.  After graduating there in 1936 with first-class honours, he went on to Cambridge to take a Ph.D. degree under Clapham, just before the war.  On his return from service with the RAF, he embarked on an administrative career, acting as Assistant Registrar at LSE during 1946-47, before moving to Nottingham University as Registrar.  But he switched to academic teaching and rejoined LSE as Lecturer in Economic History in 1949, becoming Reader (1954) and Professor (1964).'\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/1085\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/1085')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "891", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-02-02 12:27:53", "lastupdate": "1381486494", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1265113809"}, "originalsecret": "a0c0e4a55d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4017", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/4325214040/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
