Picture taken by Gavin Allan-Wood\n\n'The accidents of war guided Keith Panter-Brick into academic life.  having embarked on a business career, his plans, like those of so many others, were abruptly set aside by mobilization as a member of the Territorial Army in the late summer of 1939.  He spent the latter part of the war in a POW camp in Poland, and, as he puts it &quot;while hoeing the turnips etc turned my mind to philosophy.&quot;  With the war's end he chose to pursue these interests more systematically and went up to Keble College, Oxford to read PPE.  His first degree was followed by a BPhil in politics.  He was appointed to the School in 1950 and...in addition to periods of sabbatical leave spent in Africa, he was seconded from 1965-1967 as Professor of Public Administration at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria...His teaching extended outside the bounds of the Department of Government, much of it in co-operation with the International Relations Department, while his close involvement with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies has led to his editing two important studies of Nigerian politics.  For many years he was the vice-chairman of the Admissions Committee with responsibility for admissions to the BSc Econ.'  P.F.D.
