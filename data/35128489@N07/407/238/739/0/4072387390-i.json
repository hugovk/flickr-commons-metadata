Picture taken by Dave Elsworth\n\n'Brian Parkin came to the School in November 1956 from the National Coal Board.  As Assistant Accountant he was very much involved in his first years here in putting the School's accounting system on to a modern basis.  His skill and competence in such matters were such that de facto he was running this side of the School before he in fact became Accountant in October 1964...A mark of his energy and ability is that whilst discharging full-time, and often more than full-time, duties at LSE he recently added an Open University BA degree to his FCA qualification.  It is a matter of great regret that he has decided to retire early...'
