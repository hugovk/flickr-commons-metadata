He was a lovely man and I got on very well with him. After it was all over in October 1984 I went in to see him to thank him for his help. His manner was strange and he seemed absolutely distracted by something. At the time, I wondered if I had said something to offend him. A couple of weeks later I read his obituary in the Guardian - he had died of prostate cancer. I hadn't known that he was seriously ill. I estimate that the photograph was taken no later than 1974.", "authorname": "BScar23625", "id": "35107159-4072388334-72157622744267767", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "4072388334"}}
