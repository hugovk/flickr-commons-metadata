He had previoulsy been Stanley Jevons Professor at the University of Manchester and before that Fellow (and Bursar) of Christ's College, Cambridge and University Lecturer in Economics.  Alan Prest's name is know to every A Level economics student in Britain for his &quot;UK Economy- A Manual of Applied Economics,&quot;co-edited with D.J. Coppock, which is now in its ninth edition. To the economics profession he is well known for much more.  The title of his chair is Economics with special reference to the public sector, and in this field he has been pre-eminent.  His &quot;Public Finance in Theory and Practice&quot; first appeared in 1960 and since then has been the standard undergraduate text in Britain...Overseas his &quot;Public Finance in Developing Countries&quot; has enjoyed equal success, and this - and his wide travelling- has attracted many overseas students to take his M.Sc. option in the subject.  The hallmark of his scholarly work has been a blend of analytical insight with a concern for the practical realities.  The latter lead him to be more sceptical than most of the recent developments in the theory of public policy and to criticise - entertainingly and effectively - proposals for the reform of the tax system.  In this he wrote with considerable experience, having served on a variety of official bodies including the Departmental Committee on Liquor Licensing and the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Personal Injury.  In the School, too, Alan has borne more than his share of administrative burdens.  He has been Convenor; he has been responsible for Economics Analytical and Descriptive, and he has served on the Senate of the University and its Academic Council.  He has always been a concerned and conscientious teacher, renowned for his prompt and detailed comments on the writings of students and colleagues alike.  Face to face his encyclopaedic knowledge is always leavened by a quiet, dry sense of humour...'
