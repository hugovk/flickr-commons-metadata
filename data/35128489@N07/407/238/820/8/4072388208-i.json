His background was a BA in PPP from Oxford (1950) and an MA in Psychology from Berkeley California (1951).  It was during his time at Swansea that he developed his interest in teaching psychology in the context of its application to social administration and social work.  This formed the main focus of his teaching at LSE where he was promoted to a Professorship in Social Administration in 1969.  \n\nFor many years Garth Plowman was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the Extra-Mural Diploma in Social Work which provided a two year part-time course, mainly for married women seeking to enter social work after bring up their families.  It was virtually the only course in the country designed with this aim in mind.  Garth took a great interest in this course and helped build up a constituency of support for it within the University.\n\nHe was also the first editor of the Journal of Social Policy (1972-77) and then moved to be chairman of the editorial board (1977-80).  He played a crucial role in establishing the journal as one of the most widely respected in the subject.\n\nHis main outside interest has always been music.  He is an accomplished amateur pianist and composer and has had one of his compositions for the piano performed at a public concert.\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/596\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/596')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1349", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-11-03 12:09:15", "lastupdate": "1269945054", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1257261778"}, "originalsecret": "45035b6009", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2665", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/4072388208/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387818983}
