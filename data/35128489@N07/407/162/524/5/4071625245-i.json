The Institute wanted to do a pioneer study to see whether a clinical service incorporating psychiatric counselling was a practical proposition, and LSE was prepared to try it.  Dr Read feels the School can be proud that it was prepared to recognise the value of psychiatric counselling so early...After completing this study, Dr Read stayed on as a part-time adviser, becoming full-time in 1959 and Senior Health Service Officer when the School Health Service was launched in 1963, and under him the service has expanded in many directions.'
