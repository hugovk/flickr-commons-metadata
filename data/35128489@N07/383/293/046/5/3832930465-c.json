I'm glad Ronald Stamper is present in this collection. I remember him from the mid-80s, always suited-and-tied, though still with collar length hair, rather unfashionable and rakish by then. One of his b\u00eates noires was the pretentious usage of 'methodology' when one just meant 'method' and I remember him with a wry smile every time I hear its common misuse. A compassionate and progressive man, he encouraged me as I transmogrified from a librarian, hesitantly wondering if I was on the right course, via his ADMIS MSc into a systems analyst and thence into 20 years in electronic publishing. Now I'm back at the LSE, helping the Library with its electronic publishing: the LSE Research Online and other forthcoming repositories. (added on behalf of Peter Spring).
