'LSE Material on the history of the School' LSE Archives ref R(S.R)1101, p.123): \n\nFlorence Mare on Mr McKillop\n\nMr J.M. McKillop was the Chief Librarian all the time I was at the LSE.  He was rather a silent man, but most helpful in finding the things you needed., appreciating how precious was the little spare time of evening students.  Both he and his wife were kind to us \u2018lodgers\u2019 in London and invited us to their home.\n\nLady S. Simon on Mr Mckillop\n\nThere was also the Duo Decimo Society run by Mr McKillop, the librarian, membership of which being so limited was highly coveted.  It met regularly for dinner and discussion and members could bring guests.\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/72\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/72')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1497", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-08-19 12:32:00", "lastupdate": "1330995035", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1250682698"}, "originalsecret": "3e60593c85", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3440", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3835964475/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
