Born in 1906, he came as an Assistant Lecturer direct from Cambridge after graduating with a first in mathematics.  His job was to teach mathematics and statistics under Bowley but he got interested in economics and quickly achieved international fame for his collaborative work with Hicks on the theory of value...Appointed to the Chair of Statistics in 1944, Sir Roy has always been prepared to do more than his fair share of the less glamorous and more arduous tasks of academic administration.  He has served as an Academic Governor and a member of the University Senate.  His unflappable temperament, practical wisdom and administrative ingenuity have helped to resolve many a difficult problem in the running of the School...Always active in the interests of the statistical profession, he has been president of the Royal Statistical Society and the Econometric Society and has held various offices in the Institute of Statisticians, the International Statistical Institute and the Royal Economic Society.  He was made a fellow of the British Academy in 1952, a C.B.E in 1954 and was knighted in 1966.  His main outside  interest has been public affairs and he has usually been the first person the Government turned to when it needed advice from the outside on statistical matters...&quot;LSE Magazine, November 1943 No:46, p.9\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/99\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/99')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1584", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-09-09 16:12:49", "lastupdate": "1268756009", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1253117182"}, "originalsecret": "f44645c55b", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2498", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3926498704/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok"}
