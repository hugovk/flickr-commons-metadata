Ashton 1889-1968 (Alice Clare Carter):\n\n'LSE nearly missed getting Thomas Southcliffe Ashton as Professor of Economic History.  Colleagues and friends knew him as T.S.A. or 'Cliffe, and in footnotes should always be T.S., not Thomas S., still less Tom...T.S.A. had long been firmly settled in his beloved native north, and his somewhat reluctant acceptance in 1944 of the LSE Chair, vacant since the death of Eileen Power in 1940, we owe largely to R.H. Tawney...Ashton's first term with LSE was spent in Cambridge.  When LSE returned to Houghton Street after the war, Ashton took up quarters in a room facing the inner court of the East Wing.  Some of us remember this room... as a kind of hot-house (small in stature and slender of form, Ashton was particularly sensitive to cold).  We would find him there, between a powerful radiatior and a not negligible gas fire, sometimes with his feet on an improvised hassock.  From this vantage point he would deliver, with kindness, humour and humility, wise advice on how to set about a research project  or how to deal with some personal trouble.  The impression was that what one had come to ask about was as important to him as to oneself.'\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/100\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/100')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1248", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-09-09 16:17:50", "lastupdate": "1267482904", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1253117184"}, "originalsecret": "1efdbdf6ed", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2556", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3926498752/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387820887}
