In various of his writings he has explored the bearing of abstract ideas on practical political judgement; of this he said in his inaugural lecture that \u2018without political philosophy politics\u2026would be a practice without consciousness of the norms which inform its activity, ignorant even of its own identity or nature.\u2019  Much of his scholarly effort has gone to interpreting past masters of political thought\u2026.\nAs a teacher Maurice Cranston distinguished himself, especially by his efforts on behalf of graduate students, whose research he encouraged generously, and whose later careers he fostered: his former students remain his admirers and many have become his friends.\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/109\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/109')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1164", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-09-10 10:50:41", "lastupdate": "1303693663", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1253117196"}, "originalsecret": "a6890f9642", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3435", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/3926499236/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387820861}
