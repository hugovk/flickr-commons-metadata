I asked about the clothes the students were wearing, as everyone looks so smart; the men in particular are usually wearing jackets and often also ties. They thought that in those days clothes were more expensive, so people tended to have fewer outfits and they had to be suitable for a variety of situations, there wasn\u2019t the same division we have now between casual and smart dress. Barbara said that actually she remembered LSE students as being quite scruffy, but she had lived previously in Paris and New York, so perhaps she was used to higher standards!", "authorname": "a.towlson", "id": "35107159-3925728607-72157624805114108", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3925728607"}}
