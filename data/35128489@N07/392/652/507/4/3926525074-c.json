Fond memories of his helping we undergraduates on the B Sc (Econ) Computing Option with some of the trickier aspects of making programs work.  Particularly remember him helping me write a link routine in machine code so that my programme could run in two phases and not exceed the 16K memory limit on the IBM 1440.\n\nMind you the other memorable thing about Norman was the way his pipe had worn a gap in his false teeth!!\n\nJohn Parker 1966 - 1969 IT professional - now retired.", "authorname": "JSP - Romsey", "id": "35107159-3926525074-72157628945449753", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3926525074"}}
