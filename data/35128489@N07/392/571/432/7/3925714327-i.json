He was made a peer in 1945, and in the following year, having been appointed Lord in Waiting in Clement Attlee's Government, he resigned from the Chair.  But for years he continued on a part-time basis to teach the special subjects which he had made particularly his own, and to supervise research students.  To the end of his days he maintained his links with the School.  They were strengthened when in 1970 the School recognised his services by making him an honorary fellow.'
