In due course, he became a chartered accountant.  War service in the many interrupted this career and took him on adventurous trips through Russia...Even before the war, he had registered for the B.Com. as an evening student at LSE.  He continued as an external student after the war.  Frank Paish had a rule that, if any exam scripts told him something he did not know already, the candidates got a mark of 80; Harold Edey was one of these rare paragons, and graduated with a first in 1947.  He continued his visits to LSE - to Ronald Edwards' seminars for businessmen, and as a part-time teacher of accounting.  In 1949 he became a full time lecturer.'
