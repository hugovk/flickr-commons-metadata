After seven years, including a secondment to the Geography Department, he transferred to become a School Porter...In the next few years Mr Measures became assistant to the electrician during vacation-work, and so, in the late 1930s, began his spare time electrical training at Borough Polytechnic...His career was diverted again as he joined the Territorials in 1939 and shortly afterwards became a signalman in the Second Middlesex Imperial Yeomanry.  His wartime service, first in Norway and then in Egypt, is recalled in a series of letters between him and Mr Walter Adams, the Secretary, interrupted after a ten-line card from the POW camp in Italy where he spent four years, but recommencing to the delight of those in London in 1945...'
