In June 1969 he was appointed to a post of shift foreman and this was the position he held when he became due for retirement on 31st July 1973.  Mr Alderman had no wish either to stop working or to the leave the School at this stage, however, and asked whether it would be possible for him to continue to be employed in some capacity or other.  It so happened that the Bursar's Department needed assistance of a non-technical nature with general maintenenance matters and Mr Alderman was offered the temporary job of Maintenance Assistanr, for one year in the first instance.  He was happy to accept the offer of two extensions of this annual appointment and has now retired after giving the School an extra thee years of useful service.'
