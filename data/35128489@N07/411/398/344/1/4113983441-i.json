It was an interesting post that soon absorbed her talent and imagination and she rapidly developed skills that made her a pioneer of cartographic illustration...As new applications were found for the LUS in the field of land use planning, and as its work intensified, Biki eventually found herself as Chief Cartographer in charge of a new drawing office attached to the Land Use Division of Ministry of Agriculture....She returned to the School in 1956 to resume her career as a cartographer in the Department of Geography, having taken a break to have a family.  She retired from her psot as Chief Technician in July 1981.'
