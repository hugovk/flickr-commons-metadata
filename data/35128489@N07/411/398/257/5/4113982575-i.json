He attended grammar school in Maltby and after National Service returned to study geography at the University of Sheffield in 1951.  His undergraduate study was followed immediately by a year at Cambridge where, as a student at Corpus Christie, he was trained for the Colonial Service...Graham Ashley was then posted to Tanganyika where until 1959 he served as an administrative officer and magistrate..No doubt such activities would have continued, but with the demise of the Colonial Service in Africa, Graham returned to this country and spent his first year of transition in Argyll where, under the aegis of the Scottish Country Industries Development Trust, his task was to stimulate the development of rural industry.  That brief Scottish interlude came to an end with his appointment to the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, first as Administrative Assistant and then as Academic Registrar...'
