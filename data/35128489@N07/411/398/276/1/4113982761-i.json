She worked part-time until 1958 and she was the school health service until Dr Read came in 1952.  In 1966 all the members of the expanding Health Service moved to their present base on the 8th floor of Connaught House which Sister rates as excellent... A statistic - Sister Alexander has seen 1,200 patients a term.  Allowing for her part-time work before 1958 she has probably treated some 53,600 cases.'
