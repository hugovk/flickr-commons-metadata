During the war his fluent knowledge of Russian (and several other languages) was put to use first in the BBC Monitoring Service, then at the War Office on the General Staff.

The second was an approach from, among others, William Robson and Michael Oakshott, who had been wanting to strengthen the Government Department by adding a specialist on Soviet politics.
