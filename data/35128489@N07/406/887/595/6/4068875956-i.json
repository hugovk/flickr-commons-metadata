She was educated at the Portsmouth High School for Girls and what was then known as Kings's College of Household and Social Science (now Queen Elizabeth College) where she trained in Institutional management.  There followed a period of wide experience in hospital catering, at Whitelands Teachers' Training College and as Assistant Domestic Superintendent at the School of Agriculture, Durham County Council.  She came to the School at an interesting time in its post-war rehabilitation.  Initially there was the enormous task of helping to refurbish the School buildings after the war time occupants had left.  Later the School acquired additional premises in and around Houghton Street and there are few of them which have not benefitted from Miss Dunwoody's touch in soft furnishings and flower decorations...Before the establishment of the Student Health Service, Miss Dunwoody also dealt with emergency medical conditions in the absence of the School nurse...'
