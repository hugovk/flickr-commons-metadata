Her love of London and her concern with planning its future were furthered by a short period in the Middlesex County Planning Office from which she moved to a post with the Nature Conservancy.  In 1962 she came to the School to collaborate in the preparation of the &quot;Atlas of London and the London Region&quot;...We bade her farewell when the atlas was complete, wishing that she could have stayed with us.  Alas there was no job to offer.  But that was remedied in 1979 when the post of Map Curator became vacant and, happily Dorothy was prepared to abandon the somewhat austere environment of the Map Room at the Royal Geographical Society for the more informal atmosphere of an academic department..'
