She was promoted to Senior Assistant Librarian in 1962 and worked as deputy to the Chief Cataloguer until she assumed responsibility for day to day management of cataloguing when the Library set up its Bibliographical Services Department in 1981.  Her duties included editing several volumes of \u2018A London Bibliography of the Social Sciences.\u2019\n\nHer own historical interests lie in the ecclesiastical field: in 1974 she presented her MA thesis  on the annals of Hailes Abbey, and was involved in the British Academy project to publish Episcopal acta for the period before extant Episcopal registers.  Retirement will give her more time for this; for involvement with her parish church and local history societies near her home in Lewes and, as she is Cornish-born, with the Institute of Cornish Studies at Exeter University.\n\nMargaret is a very fair musician and was a member of the Philharmonia  Chorus for ten years.  She plays the piano and organ. And hopes to develop the latter.\n\n\nIMAGELIBRARY/1048\nPersistent URL: <a href=\"http://archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo='IMAGELIBRARY/1048')\" rel=\"nofollow\">archives.lse.ac.uk/dserve.exe?dsqServer=lib-4.lse.ac.uk&a...</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "1009", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-01-20 14:39:39", "lastupdate": "1331967001", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1264426493"}, "originalsecret": "763198cba7", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4032", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lselibrary/4303826568/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1387817546}
