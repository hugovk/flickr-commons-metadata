Secretary to the Director A.M. Carr Saunders\n\n'Mrs Elsie Betts retirement on 31st July will bring to a close a period of service which began in June 1932, when as Elsie Tudor, she joined the School as junior clerk in correspondence.  She has worked at the LSE ever since except for a period between 1946 and 1948 when she took a job in Cambridge, a place she had grown to like when she move there with the School during the war,  By 1946 she already held the post of private secretary to the Director.  She had been appointed to this post in September 1942 afterspending the previous ten years in a number of increasingly responsible positions, and it was as Director's secretary that she returned to the School in 1948.  During the next ten years Mrs Bett served two Directors, Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders and Sir Sidney Caine... She married in 1958 and her new domestic responsibilities made it necessary for her to look for a post that would demand slightly less in terms of availability although not of dedication.  She found this as assistant to Mrs Marion Horn and her successors, dealing with the appointment of academic staff...'
