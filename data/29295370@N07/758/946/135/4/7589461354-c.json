George along with brothers Albert, Joseph and sister Ellen traveled Manders Grand Star Menagerie from about 1912 to the early 1930s.  Their parents Joseph and Ellen Manders had created the menagerie in the latter part of the 19th Century after the demise/sale of William Manders Grand National Star Menagerie. We have very few photographs from that time, so this is an amazing find.", "authorname": "Muffin Days", "id": "29274040-7589461354-72157634702913421", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/7589461354/#comment72157636357926446", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "27814789@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1381332962", "_content": "Do you know that there is a Book  , Called Manders Menagerie , with lots of photo\u2019s  in it , you can buy it on Ebay , or Amazon .", "authorname": "LuckyLady777", "id": "29274040-7589461354-72157636357926446", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "7589461354"}, "flarchive:created": 1389890822}
