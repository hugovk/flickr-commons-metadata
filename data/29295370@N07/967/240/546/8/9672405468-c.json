He was a director of the company from about 1905 and I believe he ran these shops from about that time. The address was originally 7, 9 and 11, Grainger Street West, but later became 58, 60 and 62 Grainger Street.\n\nThere's a later picture taken in 1935 at; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/39821974@N06/4081040765\">www.flickr.com/photos/39821974@N06/4081040765</a>\n\nThe company minute books of board meetings are in the Tyne &amp; Wear Archives and make fascinating reading.

Electric trams were introduced in 1901, so that's the earliest date as the poles for the wiring are in the centre of the road. They wree certainly keen to get a lot of stock displayed in the windows!\n\nIn those days most houses had pictures hanging on every wall, from country mansions to working class terraces. Until the Great War this was a highly profitable department of the business. Things changed after 1914. Pictures were still popular until the Second World War, but the gallery and fine art department were in decline. This picture must have been taken when  it was at its peak.\n\nAt this time the company had created a separate department to market prints in colour or black and white of a painting &quot;Despised and Rejected of Men!&quot;  by Sigismund Goetze, 1904. It travelled around Britain with a lecturer giving talks about the picture. I have a large black and white copy and the pamphlet that went with it.  Prints were still being sold to churches in the USA in the 1960's!
