It focuses in particular on life along the foreshore at South Shields during the 1950s but also includes a few images from further down the coast.\n\nSouth Shields has long been a popular seaside resort and also has a proud industrial heritage. Times have changed, though, and many of the old industries such as shipbuilding and coal mining have disappeared. Rather than stand still and accept this change in fortunes, South Tyneside Council is pressing ahead with an ambitious vision to transform the Foreshore, Town Centre and Riverside areas into vibrant destinations. Haven Point is a key part of this change.\n\nTyne &amp; Wear Archives and South Tyneside Local Studies Library have a vital role to play in this. As South Shields is regenerated and forever changed the Archives and Local Studies serve as its memory. We keep alive a window into the town\u2019s past, preserving the history of people, places and industries that no longer exist. South Shields must look forward but its sense of direction will be lost if it forgets where it came from.\n\nThese images, together with a fantastic selection from South Tyneside Local Studies Library, can be seen in a digital exhibition at Haven Point. You can also see images from the Local Studies Library online at <a href=\"http://www.southtynesideimages.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.southtynesideimages.org.uk/</a>. \n\nA Blog on this collection of images can be read <a href=\"http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/engage/blog/south-shields-foreshore-preserving-the-memories/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>\n\n(Copyright) We're happy for you to share these digital images within the spirit of The Commons.
