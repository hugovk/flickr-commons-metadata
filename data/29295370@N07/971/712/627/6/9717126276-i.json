The photograph was taken on the 13th of September 1967.\n\nReference: 5417/191/3\n\nThis collection of images has been assembled in support of the Washington Heritage Festival 2013.\n\nThe celebration of Washington brings together a variety of different themes. Washington is a Town in the City of Sunderland, Tyne &amp; Wear. It is traditionally associated with Coal Industry, and notably known as the home of the Washington Family, ancestors of the First President of the United States George Washington.\n\nHowever, in 1964 Washington was designated a New Town and drastically changed. With the introduction of new industry such as the Nissan Car Factory Washington experienced a huge redevelopment in both its economy and community. \n\nThese Photographs are taken from the Records of the Washington Development Corporation; held at Tyne &amp; Wear Archives. The records document this change in industry, landscape and community in Washington between 1964 &amp; 1988, and consist of many photographs. \n\nFor more information on the Washington Heritage Festival, 21st September 2013 please click <a href=\"http://www.sunderlandlive.co.uk/washington-heritage-festival\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\n\n(Copyright) These images are Crown Copyright.
