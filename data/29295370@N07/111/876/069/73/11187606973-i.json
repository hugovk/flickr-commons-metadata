From the development of turret ships in the 1890s and the production of Doxford opposed piston engines after the First World War through to the designs for Liberty ships in the 1940s and SD14s in the 1960s. Sunderland has much to be proud of.\n\nTyne &amp; Wear Archives cares for tens of thousands of photographs in its shipbuilding collections. Most of these focus on the ships \u2013 in particular their construction, launch and sea trials. This set looks to redress the balance and to celebrate the work of the men and women who have played such a vital part in the region\u2019s history. The images show the human side of this great story, with many relating to the world famous shipbuilding and engineering firm William Doxford &amp; Sons Ltd.\n\nThe Archives has produced <a href=\"http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/engage/blog/remembering-the-shipyard-workers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a short blog to accompany these images.</a> \n\n(Copyright) We're happy for you to share these digital images within the spirit of The Commons.
