This was officially opened by Admiral Sir Casper John, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, on September 15th, 1961.\n\nTurbinia was then moved in 1994 to her new home, Discovery Museum, where people lined the streets to watch the journey through the City of Newcastle.\n\nThere's a video on Youtube showing the move, I believe this is the link below.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefE-sXygyU\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.youtube.com/watch?v=AefE-sXygyU</a>", "authorname": "Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums", "id": "29274040-5424585191-72157625877875057", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5424585191/#comment72157626007348140", "realname": "", "path_alias": "alimarante", "author": "41675580@N08", "iconserver": "6105", "datecreate": "1297207369", "_content": "Thank you TWAM, it's lovely to see information like this about my old part of England.\nI come from Chester-le-Street but have lived for the last nearly forty years here in New Zealand.\nI'm very glad that this site and TWAM have met.", "authorname": "FrigateRN", "id": "29274040-5424585191-72157626007348140", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5424585191/#comment72157626007612320", "realname": "Tony", "path_alias": null, "author": "53879693@N02", "iconserver": "4092", "datecreate": "1297210284", "_content": "Cool video, thanks !!", "authorname": "baracudatony", "id": "29274040-5424585191-72157626007612320", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5424585191/#comment72157625891535491", "realname": "", "path_alias": "twm_news", "author": "29295370@N07", "iconserver": "3774", "datecreate": "1297331578", "_content": "FrigateRN - Didn't realise you were from Chester-le-street, after you said the site was run from New Zealand.
