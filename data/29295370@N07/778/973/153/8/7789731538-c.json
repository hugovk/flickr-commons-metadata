It was stated that the police were about to arrest him and another man for alleged attempted burglary at a near-by hotel. The other man was arrested.\n\nAt Newcastle police court yesterday, JAMES BISCOFF WHITEHEAD, 28, of Back Scotswood Road, unemployed, labourer, was remanded for a week on a charge of attempting to break into Benwell Hotel in Adelaide Terrace with intent to commit a felony.\n\nInspector Russell said he surrounded the building with the aid of persons  living near by. Hall, the dead man, who had a jemmy, knocked off a chimney stack and threw slates and masonry on to the crowd below. In attempting to knock off another chimney pot he fell into the backyard and met his death through a fractured skull. The witness added that Whitehead jumped into the back lane and was arrested.\n\n<i>[Many thanks to Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums for uploading these extraordinary photographs, and to the State Library of Western Australia for their research seminars and online resources].</i>", "authorname": "wattlesong", "id": "29274040-7789731538-72157631211287418", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/7789731538/#comment72157631211648254", "realname": "Seth Gaines", "path_alias": "sethgaines", "author": "38714066@N00", "iconserver": "3", "datecreate": "1345749436", "_content": "You must be right.
