Your site's been very informative. \nI was in Bamburgh Castle probably more than 20 years ago. But my memories--which must be getting fuddled--were of it being by a beach! It's longer since I've been in Newcastle itself. \nYour pictures have inspired me to  get back down there. Whenever  my wife and drive through England it's via Cumbria. We must change that. We used to go down through Northumberland via Berwick.\nThe Geordies are great people and very friendly.\nThanks for your excellent site.", "authorname": "Martin Horan", "id": "29274040-5148902028-72157630726465604", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5148902028/#comment72157631318428456", "realname": "Barry Ranns", "path_alias": "bazranz", "author": "86174375@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1346321860", "_content": "Isn't this Alnwick Castle?", "authorname": "bazranz", "id": "29274040-5148902028-72157631318428456", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5148902028"}}
