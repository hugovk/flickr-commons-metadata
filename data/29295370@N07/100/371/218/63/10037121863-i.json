The album gives us a fascinating glimpse of life at the company's shipyard at Hebburn from the late 1930s to the 1960s. There are remarkable images of the men at work in the yard and a poignant series showing the terrible damage caused during the Second World War to HMS Kelly, one of Hawthorn Leslie's best loved ships.\n\nThis particular collection of images follows the Birth and ultimate Death of a ship. From the craft and pride in its production and the joy in its performance, to the devastation and price of its destruction. \n\nA blog about this fascinating collection can been viewed <a href=\"//www.twmuseums.org.uk/engage/blog/hms-kelly-commemorating-the-men-who-built-her-and-served-on-her/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> on the Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums website.\n\n(Copyright) We're happy for you to share these digital images within the spirit of The Commons.
