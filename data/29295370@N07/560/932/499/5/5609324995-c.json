I was a little kid in Jarrow in the 60s and the sense of pride that we were still (just about) building the world's biggest ships (supertankers by then) was everywhere. \n\nBut now? Everything's got a price and the work goes where the price is lowest. You have to remember that the industrial revolution was driven yes by ingenuity and determination and genius, but also by the fact that Britain had a huge empire to service and massive revenues from it. We were once the only nation in the world that even could build ships this size. Now they can be built anywhere and it tends to be where the labour's cheapest.\n\nI'd love to see Britain be able to call itself Great again but I don't think it'll be through engineering. Sadly we are just not an economic powerhouse any more, we're a small to middling economy.", "authorname": "SteveFE", "id": "29274040-5609324995-72157626755708356", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5609324995/#comment72157626635277903", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mias", "author": "93072638@N00", "iconserver": "6", "datecreate": "1305843581", "_content": "Splendid picture.", "authorname": "Miguel\u00e1ngel", "id": "29274040-5609324995-72157626635277903", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5609324995/#comment72157629498390678", "realname": "Charlie Powell", "path_alias": "olovecharlieo", "author": "22743973@N08", "iconserver": "5346", "datecreate": "1334962866", "_content": "Nice old shot of the Mauretania, she certainly does look like she's moving at speed!", "authorname": "love-charlie", "id": "29274040-5609324995-72157629498390678", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5609324995/#comment72157632217708467", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "90661183@N04", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1355212052", "_content": "beautiful photo friend", "authorname": "slaverobertslut12", "id": "29274040-5609324995-72157632217708467", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/5609324995/#comment72157636983665885", "realname": "Marc FORESTIER", "path_alias": null, "author": "101959291@N02", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1382827513", "_content": "Here we have the Greyhound of the Seas, the mighty and beloved Maury!
