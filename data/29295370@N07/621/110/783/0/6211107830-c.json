Then I saw that the snakes right eye was hanging right down out of the socket and dangling on it's 'cheek'.....the mongoose must have had a go at it.\nIt was about then that my legs started to shake, my knees started to knock and I started to think of my mother and how much she would miss me!\nThe Fakir must have realised what was going to happen because he suddenly grabbed the snakes tail and whipped it away from my face just as it struck!\nI had a beard and as the beasts fangs snapped shut in the beard as it was dragged clear it pulled a big chunk of my beard out with it.....that bloody hurt as well!\nNow I can tell you the following true facts, your knees DO knock, you DO go grey with fear and after something like this your chums DO have to lead you away and buy you a pint!\nOh! and after all that my dingbat of a mate had'nt even got a picture, he could'nt figure out how to work the bloody camera!\nDid I go back and try again?..........Yeah.......riiiiggghhht!", "authorname": "FrigateRN", "id": "29274040-6211107830-72157627817556026", "iconfarm": 7}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/6211107830/#comment72157627695342899", "realname": "", "path_alias": "twm_news", "author": "29295370@N07", "iconserver": "2861", "datecreate": "1317764117", "_content": "@FrigateRN Cracker of a story!", "authorname": "Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums", "id": "29274040-6211107830-72157627695342899", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twm_news/6211107830/#comment72157627706624469", "realname": "Wendy Tortoriello", "path_alias": "lovethesky", "author": "57878783@N07", "iconserver": "5242", "datecreate": "1317906353", "_content": "Wow, look at that skin he's wearing.
