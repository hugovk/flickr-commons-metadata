He too had brown hair and blue eyes, only my father was 6'1&quot; tall. I'm going to try looking into the relation of them and see if in fact we are related. I have always been drawn to an English garden, it is peaceful to me but I have never been to England. I was born in the US. Could it be b/c I am of English decent? As I looked into this more for records of birth and such, I would have to go to England to research or FLY there...I guess I will really never know how he was related, if so. If anyone knows how I can do this online myself,  please let me know. I can be reached at customangelcakes@yahoo.com.
