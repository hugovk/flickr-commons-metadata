These were later replaced with 4 bladed propellers. As far as I understand it all four propellers where changed and I suspect that this photograph was taken part way through the process. You can see that the two outboard propellers have 4 blades and the two inboard ones have three. If you look at the starboard inboard propeller you can see that it appears to have been nibbled! I would suggest that replacement with a 4 bladed type is imminent.

The main text indicates that the inner props were changed to 4 bladed type in 1908, but your photo contradicts that. Also, looking at your photo, those 4 blade jobs still have the writing on the blades and there is no other supports or gear around to start work on the inner ones. I suggest the outer props were changed after hitting debris (hence the chunk out of stbd inner) and this photo is taken before she left Canada dock in January 1909.
