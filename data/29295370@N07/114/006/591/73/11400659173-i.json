However, during the Victorian Era Christmas as we know it today was invented, and our modest medieval traditions of evergreens and food were transformed.\n\nMuch if this change was due to Queen Victoria and her marriage to the German-born Prince Albert. Albert introduced many aspects of Christmas as we know it, most notably the first Christmas tree in the royal family\u2019s home. This was a tradition Albert brought to his family from his own childhood in Germany, but also to every other family in Britain. \n\nAs a result the Victorians also transformed the idea of Christmas so that it became centred around the family, and our modern day traditions are deeply rooted in those of Victorian Society. \n\n(Copyright) We're happy for you to share these digital images within the spirit of The Commons.
