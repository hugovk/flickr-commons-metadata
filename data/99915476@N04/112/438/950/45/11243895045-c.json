The company was owned by four or five individuals who possessed one other ship. She was renamed the Komagata Maru.\n\nIn 1914 the Komagata Maru was central to what became known as the Komagata Maru Incident, which involved 354 passengers from India who unsuccessfully attempted to immigrate to Canada. To accommodate the passengers, the lower deck was cleaned and fitted with latrines and wooden benches. The ship sailed back to India where, after disembarking from the ship, some of the passengers were killed in an incident with police authorities.\n\nIn 1924, the ship was renamed Heian Maru. She was wrecked on Cape Soyedomari, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan on 11 February 1926.\n\nTonnage: 3,040 GRT\nLength: 100.3 m (329 ft 1 in) (LPP)\nBeam: 12.7 m (41 ft 8 in)\nInstalled power: 1 triple-expansion steam engine, single screw propeller\nSpeed: 11 knots (20 km/h)", "authorname": "Scumbag*College", "id": "99883337-11243895045-72157638472628093", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "11243895045"}}
