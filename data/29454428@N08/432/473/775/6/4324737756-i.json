Lieutenant FitzGeorge was the second son of HRH Duke of Cambridge and an actress, and a great grandson of George III, and so was a second cousin to Alfred, who was the second son of Queen Victoria. FitzGeorge was not entitled to any royal prerogatives or titles. He became a rear admiral in the Royal Navy later.\n\nWikipedia biography of FitzgGeorge: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphus_FitzGeorge\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphus_FitzGeorge</a>\n\nFormat: Photograph\n \nNotes: Find more detailed information about this photograph: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=886784\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=886784</a>\n\nSearch for more great images in the State Library's collections: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n \nFrom the collection of the State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3811", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2010-02-02 17:43:43", "lastupdate": "1382781458", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1265093023"}, "originalsecret": "8a4fa84908", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4063", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4324737756/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607327}
