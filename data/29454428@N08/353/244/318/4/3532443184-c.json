It was a big aircraft for its power, and as a result very lightly built. There was poor response to control movements in certain speed ranges, the wings were inclined to twist badly if the ailerons were used coarsely and, most seriously, the vertical tail surface was of inadequate area. The result was an aircraft that, although quite safe under normal conditions, could rapidly get out of control under certain flight regimes.&quot;   \n\nMore info: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Express\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Express</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-3532443184-72157618313224659", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3532443184/#comment72157618403440288", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1242634098", "_content": "Yes, Qantas has even lost lives, but they have never lost the life of anyone flying in one of their jet aircraft, hence the safety reputation.
