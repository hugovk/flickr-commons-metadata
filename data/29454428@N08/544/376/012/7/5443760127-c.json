The cricket match was evidently played at Lyne Park, Rose Bay, in January 1931. &quot;The Home&quot; item featured several of Sam Hood's pics which are in the SLNSW collection (see links below), but for some reason this one wasn't included...maybe it was considered inappropriate given Capt Chalmers was married...From what I can scrape together courtesy of various sources, Chalmers was on loan from the Royal Navy in the period 1929-1931, during which time he was Captain of HMAS Australia. Later in his career he became a Rear Admiral - <a href=\"http://www.npgprints.com/image/941012/hay-wrightson-ltd-william-scott-chalmers\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.npgprints.com/image/941012/hay-wrightson-ltd-william-...</a>\n\nThe first 4 of these SLNSW pics all appear in &quot;The Home&quot; item with captions which enable us to identify some of the people involved...alas the dog isn't named...going on the captions, it's in the custody of Mrs Chalmers  -  \n    \n<a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50691\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50691</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50695\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50695</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50692\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50692</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50688\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50688</a>\n\nSeveral other Sam Hood pics in the SLNSW collection also appear to have been taken at the naval cricket match...as is evident Sam Hood needed a couple of goes to get the main group pic right...people blinking out of sync etc.\n\n<a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50680\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50680</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50681\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50681</a> ;  <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50694\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50694</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50689\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50689</a>\n\nNot quite so sure about these ones - \n\n<a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50683\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50683</a> ; <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50684\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=50684</a> ;\n\nDiscovered whilst drawing more blanks trying to track down the cruelly maligned mother-in-law... <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5444358738/\">www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5444358738/</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-5443760127-72157632109145511", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5443760127/#comment72157632115459163", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1354061782", "_content": "Thanks Quasymody - you've given us some more work but looks like you're on the right track.
