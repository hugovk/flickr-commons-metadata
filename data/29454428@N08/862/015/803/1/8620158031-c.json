After all, the armies that overthrew that regime also had dress uniforms with much the same features.\n\nIf we are going to get picayune here, these boy band outfits have scalloped trim on the cuffs--a hallmark of 19th Century European military uniforms. No Third Reich uniform had scalloped trim, and the straight trim cuff which had been part of the German uniform since adopted by the Prussian military in the 1820s was eliminated in 1940. Moreover, these boy band blouses are notably short. The bottom of all Wehrmacht tunics matched the length of its sleeves. \n\nPerhaps the boys' peaked visor caps remind some people of the Wehrmacht's dress caps. No reason they should. Most organizations in the West adopted this design in the early 20th Century and continue to wear them, although the exaggerated height of the peak adopted by the USSR and other commie nations has always struck me as goofy looking.\n\nAnd speaking of goofy, you really must see the Leningrad Cowboys gonzo rock band and the Red Army Choir perform Sweet Home Alabama.

You're accurate in your history Sixpounder, yet the average person today fallows the Kardashian's on TV and not the history of uniforms.

I don't even wear a mustache and his uniforms were much more garish than that of the Air Corps! But, it's that so many have a very limited association to history and the rolls uniforms played.
