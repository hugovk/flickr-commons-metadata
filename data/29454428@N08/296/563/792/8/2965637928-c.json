The cool thing is that even though these women are the main point of focus , there are verious other interesting things going on like the man on the bike shows how from then to modern day transport has progressed (even though we used bikes) and also, the strructuring of the buildings is very victorian (1800 to aboout 1900). Overall, my opinion is that all though this picture was taken by an amateur, it strikes me as amazing.
