My mistake. However they did have Bandmasters in those days. All, or nearly all, the Directors of Music passed through the NCO ranks as Bandmasters before being commissioned and appointed as Directors of Music. \n\n@timg2003    The 1952 publication &quot;The King's Guards&quot; by Major Henry Legge-Bourke refers to Foot Guards musicians as &quot;bandsmen&quot; so I'm fairly sure that was the term used in 1934. My understanding is that the term &quot;Musician&quot; was introduced when female musicians were accepted into the bands, and I believe that was the 1980's.\n\nHOWEVER I am always happy to have my knowledge expanded on these issues.
