That radiator shape was fairly common at the time and would date the vehicle to around 1910-12. The O-class tram #964 came into service sometime between 1908 and 1914. So I would suggest  that this photo was taken around 1912-14. By 1920 there most probably would have been a few more cars on the road than the 3 visible in this photo.", "authorname": "juantoo34", "id": "29361615-5955844045-72157638606497265", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5955844045"}, "flarchive:created": 1389893388}
