While she wrote throughout her life, her other major literary success, <i>All That Swagger</i>, was not published until 1936.\n\n&quot;She has had a long-lasting impact on Australian literary life through her endowment of a major literary award known as the <i>Miles Franklin Award</i>.&quot; <i>&ndash;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Franklin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></i>\n\nNotes on this photograph from <a href=\"http://mgnsw.org.au/uploaded/GC_exhibition catalogue.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Margot Riley</a>:<blockquote>&quot;This portrait shows Miles Franklin at the age of 22. It was taken in 1902, the year following the publication of <i>My Brilliant Career</i> ...\n\n&quot;This image was shot in Goulburn, New South Wales, at local photographer Hy Dorner\u2019s <i>Elite Studio</i>, and records the young celebrity author, modishly attired in a figure-hugging, tailored riding habit and holding a riding crop in her tightly gloved hands. Her hair is tied back and hanging behind her, most probably in a long braid. The photograph is signed by Franklin\u2014\u2018Merrily Miles\u2019\u2014her favoured epithet at the time.&quot;</blockquote>", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29361615-3346071500-72157615092367110", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3346071500/#comment72157615106834088", "realname": "Meisam fa", "path_alias": "_meisam_", "author": "22745228@N05", "iconserver": "3307", "datecreate": "1236784165", "_content": "<b><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Miles_Franklin,_1902.jpg\">Now on Wikimedia Commons</a>\n</b><a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3560/3312955411_23201ab4ed_o.jpg\" /></a>", "authorname": "Meisam\u200c", "id": "29361615-3346071500-72157615106834088", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3346071500/#comment72157620583870894", "realname": "MARVIN 345", "path_alias": null, "author": "30797788@N03", "iconserver": "7356", "datecreate": "1246007715", "_content": "fantastic", "authorname": "marvin 345", "id": "29361615-3346071500-72157620583870894", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3346071500/#comment72157621931570470", "realname": "", "path_alias": "eva_froncek", "author": "55189240@N00", "iconserver": "7173", "datecreate": "1249301648", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1190170@N21/\">GOULBURN, NSW</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "Eva_F11", "id": "29361615-3346071500-72157621931570470", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3346071500/#comment72157624988647965", "realname": "", "path_alias": "brielstyle", "author": "47294913@N02", "iconserver": "2680", "datecreate": "1286451195", "_content": "beautiful dress!!!!! beautiful woman.. una amazzone :)", "authorname": ".ElisaB.", "id": "29361615-3346071500-72157624988647965", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3346071500/#comment72157625453690853", "realname": "", "path_alias": "northwestkathleen", "author": "40108713@N04", "iconserver": "7421", "datecreate": "1292123534", "_content": "Bet that corset waist cincher is a killer!!!
