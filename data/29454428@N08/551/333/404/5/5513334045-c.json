As vrai points out (above), most of this crowd are probably spooks...Special Branch detectives, or whoever looked after our national interest  in the 1930s.

Of course nowadays the Special Branch detectives are likely to have an IT masters degree and instead of hanging out at the Domain, they'll be sitting in an office somewhere tracking us all and reading our thoughts (or double guessing and fabricating what they don't in fact know), courtesy of Google, etc...then they'll probably be selling the data they mine to advertisers, marketing agencies, recruitment agencies, debt collectors, the media and anyone else who wants to pay for it...of course it's all in the national interest for the State to be spying on its citizens...democracy in action!\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/29634931@N03] I can count 5 women and maybe 10 or more possibles...they didn't allow women to be spooks in the 1930s (!); All up it's interesting to see how few women appear in this pic. Going on what we see here, you'd tend to conclude that during the 1930s (at least), the Domain soapbox orator's scene was a predominantly male space.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-5513334045-72157629039699495", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "5513334045"}, "flarchive:created": 1389893670}
