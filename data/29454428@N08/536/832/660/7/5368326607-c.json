The Library collects items which document the life and history of NSW specifically and, more broadly, Australia (although the other State Libraries look after their own states). To this end we still actively collect photographs - both physical and digital - which are current, from private and professional photographers. The only reason you see 'old' shots up on Flickr is that for them to be part of the Flickr Commons, they need to be out of copyright, which, under Australian law, is any photograph taken before 1955.", "authorname": "State Library of New South Wales collection", "id": "29361615-5368326607-72157625863054900", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5368326607/#comment72157625937324690", "realname": "Angelo Bonetta", "path_alias": "ganagafoto", "author": "77583847@N00", "iconserver": "54", "datecreate": "1296392017", "_content": "Wow, where Jack Torrance is?\nCiao, Angelo", "authorname": "ganagafoto", "id": "29361615-5368326607-72157625937324690", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "5368326607"}, "flarchive:created": 1389893796}
