As the Bridge only opened in March 1932, and white lane lines went in around June (guess why!!!), this picture is some time between March and June 1932. By the westerly afternoon shadow lines, the sun still fairly high in the afternoon, I would say not long after the Bridge opening in March. They can't be the very first cars at the toll bar because there is already a fair bit of oil on the road from stopped cars.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "29361615-2878535880-72157632916275777", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/2878535880/#comment72157634394786892", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1372525313", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "29361615-2878535880-72157634394786892", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "2878535880"}, "flarchive:created": 1389898390}
