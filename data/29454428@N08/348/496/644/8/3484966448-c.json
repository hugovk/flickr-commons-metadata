Were they implying that the monument was too sacred for the public to approach, or that the public were not to be trusted, or both? I do not think that graffitti was a problem in the early 1900s, so it cannot have been the latter. Today the railings are no longer there, and the monument looks a lot better for it.", "authorname": "Captain Cook Society", "id": "29361615-3484966448-72157619191255143", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "3484966448"}, "flarchive:created": 1389897836}
