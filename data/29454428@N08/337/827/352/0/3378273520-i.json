Undemonstrative in behaviour, she approached her singing like a craft, meticulously and unostentatiously. She dressed simply and did not shun menial tasks. Her large, informal parties were memorable for her superb cooking, especially for her pie with seventy dozen oysters. Perhaps it was also her sense of fun and tender-heartedness that attracted her large following of 'gallery girls', women who queued for standing room and followed her movements with flowers and mail. She became a legend in Australia in her lifetime, respected by her professional colleagues and loved by her devoted public.'\n<a href=\"http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100536b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100536b.htm</a>\n\nFormat: Photograph\n \nNotes: Find more detailed information about this photograph: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=153809\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=153809</a>\n\nSearch for more great images in the State Library's collections: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n \nFrom the collection of the State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4623", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1937-04-13 14:37:38", "lastupdate": "1377700516", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1237779458"}, "originalsecret": "8350fc2725", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3639", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3378273520/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389897971}
