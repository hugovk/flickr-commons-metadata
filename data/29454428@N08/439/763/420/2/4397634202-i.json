He was posed in the studio with his hand on a headclamp,  the nugget was inserted and both placed on a photograph of the verandah of his mansion, built from the proceeds of his goldmine. The &quot;nugget&quot; was found in Hill End, New South Wales on 19th October 1872. More than half of the 630 lbs weight was pure gold, value 12,000 pounds ($24,000). With gold worth say $1400 per ounce, the value today would be over $A7,000,000. Amazingly Holtermann's mine had already made him rich before the discovery of this boulder and there was reputed to be an even larger aggregate in the mine!\n\nFormat: Photograph\n \nNotes: Find more detailed information about this photograph: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=888373\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=888373</a>\n\nSearch for more great images in the State Library's collections: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n \nFrom the collection of the State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "11420", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1875-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1344007043", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1267422224"}, "originalsecret": "d8488c4d7d", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2700", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4397634202/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389894112}
