He was a triple Olympic swimming champion and twice a silver medallist in three Olympic Games.\n\nReginald (&quot;Snowy&quot;) Leslie Baker (8 February 1884 \u2013 2 December 1953) was an Australian athlete, sports promoter and film actor. At 16 he played in the Australian Rugby Union team against Great Britain. At 17 he was middleweight boxing champion of New South Wales, and at 18 took the middleweight and heavyweight boxing titles of Australia. Baker was also prominent at polo, water polo, cricket and diving, and proficient in surfing, fencing, hockey, rowing, yachting and equestrian events. He appeared at the 1908 London Olympics, representing Australasia in the 4x200m freestyle relay, finishing fourth, and in the diving where he lost in the first round, coming seventh against the powerful Germans who dominated the sport at the time. He also took part in the Olympic boxing competition, where he lost the final match against Johnny Douglas, winning a silver medal. Douglas' father, J H Douglas, as President of the Amateur Boxing Association, presented his son with the gold medal and Baker with the silver. The official report did not name referees, but a number of newspaper and magazine reports later claimed that Douglas senior had refereed the final and Baker confirmed this in an interview in 1952 with respected journalist Norman Bartlett. The pair met in a bare-knuckle return match at a London club and Baker knocked Douglas out.\nReference: Wikipedia\n\nFormat: Photograph\n \nNotes: Find more detailed information about this photograph: <a href=\"http://libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/FULL/PM/BSEARCH/19/52652,2\">libapp.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/spydus/FULL/PM/BSEARCH/19/52...</a>\n\nSearch for more great images in the State Library's collections: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n \nFrom the collection of the State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "12684", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2009-03-27 09:28:03", "lastupdate": "1331022838", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1238106483"}, "originalsecret": "daf89a3abb", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3451", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3387857625/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389608234}
