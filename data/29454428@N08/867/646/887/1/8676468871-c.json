I was surprised to find his photo here! He was, according to my Mother and Grandmother, the nicest, most caring man they had met; let alone be related to. He was present for most of the major battles of the 20th Battalion (not 50th as noted above) and was wounded 3 times. Once at Galippoli and twice in France - those being shot superficially in the jaw, shrapnel wounds to the back and forearm and gassed respectively. Ironically, he met my Great Grandmother in the British War Hospital while recovering from the last two. My Grandmother recalls how he thought this was providence and so asked for her hand and returned to Australia.

I have purchased a copy of his records from the NAA already, but this was only in the last 2 months - it is amazing to read and own to supplement my 'bits and pieces' (as my dear Nan calls them) associated with his life in the military. I have several other photographs, including a 20th Battalion band picture - if you feel these would be a worthy additive to this collection I could forward you a scanned copy if you would like?", "authorname": "Mortox", "id": "29361615-8676468871-72157635369849137", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8676468871"}, "flarchive:created": 1389605074}
