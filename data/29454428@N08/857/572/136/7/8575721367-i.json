It was not a nugget of pure gold but he was instantly rich! An even larger gold find was broken up when it came to the surface in late January-early February 1873 but it was not photographed. With his wealth Holtermann financed the photography of the goldfields, a collection of international significance showing the ordinary people from all over the world with their houses and businesses on the goldfields \nThis collection has now been UNESCO listed and an exhibition of the highest definition photographs of the collection, titled The Greatest Wonder of the World, will run in the State Library of New South Wales until 12 May 2013\nThis composite photograph was put together later to give the appearance of Holtermann with the gold on the veranda of his new mansion at North Sydney, now the site of Shore Grammar School. Originally he was photographed in Hill End with the gold, then later re-photographed in the same pose , but with better clothes, in Sydney. The two images were put together.\n\nFormat: Photograph\n\nFind more detailed information about this photographic collection: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=63857\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=63857</a>\n\nHoltermann Collection: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/simpleSearch.aspx?authority=creatorauthorartist&amp;ID=589\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/simpleSearch.aspx?authority=cre...</a>\n\nThe Greatest Wonder of the World Exhibition: <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2013/holtermann/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2013/holtermann/inde...</a>\n\nFrom the collection of the State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>\n"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4817", "farm": 9, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1874-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1378436085", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1363836226"}, "originalsecret": "f3eeb88346", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "8515", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8575721367/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389892715}
