Per the digitised newspapers, M.W. Kavanagh of 225 William St transferred his wine and spirit merchant's license to Dorahy Bros in January 1887 - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13625718\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13625718</a> ...several SMH births notices and the NSW BDMs indicate that this would have been Michael William Kavanagh, who was married to Annie. Kavanagh appears to have moved on from 225 William St at about the time of the license transfer. Probably the best advert which shows that Kavanagh operated as a grocer is the one mentioned by Beachcomber (above), which ran in the SMH during December 1881 (far rhs column, 9th from top)- <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28383386\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28383386</a> ...per Beachcomber's observation, note the refs to Bass &amp; Co's Ale, Guinness's Stout, Albury Wines...all up I'd say there's a good chance that this pic involves Kavanagh's premises at 225 William Street...or if not, then I'd say that at the very least it involves an advertisement for Kavanagh's on a wall close by (here keep in mind that the sign doesn't indicate to the passer-by where Kavanagh's is...which would of course have been unnecessary if it were painted on one of Kav's walls). When you look at the pic...well the 'known knowns' are that the street is aligned roughly East-West and there's quite a significant incline towards the rhs (which would fit with parts of William Street as it was in the 1880s)...it's a pity the writing on the sign above the awning (top left) is too small to read at this resolution (hint!)...and you'd like to think that the substantial building on the right would have attracted the occasional photographer or newspaper artist over the years...it looks like a government building, bank, insurance office, etc. It's interesting that there aren't too many hits on the digitised newspapers in the 1880-1890 period for 'Budweiser'...most of the adverts appear in the mid 1880s...talk about coals to Newcastle! Mate!\n\nAnyway, wherever it is, this is yet another fantastic pic! I want one of those brooms! You can't buy a decent broom anywhere these days!
