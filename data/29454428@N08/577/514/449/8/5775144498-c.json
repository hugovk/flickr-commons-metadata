I wonder if this photo and the others in the series around Circular Quay (and Manly) were taken on the same day?  The crowds of families (not workers) heading between the Quay and the tram terminus up Phillip Street are strikingly similar. As are the telegraph poles (!), vegetation, and shipping.\n\nSee notes and comments here -\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2495797591/]", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-5775144498-72157626725734235", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5775144498"}, "flarchive:created": 1389606523}
