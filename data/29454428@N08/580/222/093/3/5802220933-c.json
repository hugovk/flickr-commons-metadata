Railway Square was originally known as Central Square and it was the heart of Sydney's modern retail district in the 1800s and early 1900s...\n\nSydney Glaciarium finally closed in 1955, two years earlier than the Melbourne rink. Of the buildings flanking the narrow entry to the Glaci on George Street, Wembly House still exists and the shops at 849-855 are now a protected heritage place of high architectural significance due in part to their connection to ice skating history (Technocity / Glaciarium, National Trust Register 6560). However, the actual rink at the rear is gone.\n\n<a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/carpenter.architects/icelife46/future/glaciariumsyd.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">homepage.mac.com/carpenter.architects/icelife46/future/gl...</a>", "authorname": "myhappypenguin", "id": "29361615-5802220933-72157630207092720", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5802220933"}, "flarchive:created": 1389606449}
