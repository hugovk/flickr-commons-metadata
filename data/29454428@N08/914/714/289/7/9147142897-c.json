As things stand, only the Bridge St facade has its full complement of statues.\n\nThe Bridge St statues at the Lands Office were added to their niches during <del>1991-1993</del> 1891-1893. Fortunately, the newspapers of the day ran a number of reports and news items on the statues, and these can now be easily tracked down via the (truly wonderful) NLA digitised newspapers...many of the contemporary newspaper items refer to the sculptor who produced the statue, and in many instances we are informed of a precise date on which particular statues were placed...whilst in other instances the newspaper items provide enough information so that we can arrive at an approximate date on which a statue was placed...and maybe as more newspapers are digitised some dates might be narrowed further. If anyone is interested I've attached the links to my various sources over at this <del>PHM</del> SRNSW pic <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5401920179/\">www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/5401920179/</a>\n\nAll up, the various items and reports which appear in the contemporary newspapers indicate that this Fred Hardie album pic was taken in the fairly narrow period from 27/6/1892 (when Bass was added <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article112940809\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article112940809</a>) to ca. ? late July or early August 1892 (when Flinders and Sturt were added...in this Fred Hardie pic both Flinders' and Sturt's niches are vacant <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article112602891\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article112602891</a>)\n\nAs of 2013, only 4 statues have been placed in the Gresham St niches...per the digitised newspapers, the Gresham St statues appear to have been added in the period 1901-1902 (still not too sure re Parkes and Martin)...hence all the Gresham St niches are vacant in this pic\n\nWhilst the selection of statues might make us cringe slightly today, at a point when narratives of 19th century European exploration have been revisited and re-evaluated and probably deconstructed ad infinitum as well, we need to keep in mind that the Lands Office statues were placed at a time when Australian nationalism was still in its infancy, when nationalist intellectuals were seeking to promote a sense of Australian identity and to develop nationalist narratives based around ideas of exploration and (peaceful) settlement...and at a time when Australian school children grew up reciting the names of kings and queens of England rather than those of the explorers and public figures whose statues feature on the Lands Office facades.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.publicartaroundtheworld.com/Lands_Department_Building.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.publicartaroundtheworld.com/Lands_Department_Building...</a> worth checking out", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-9147142897-72157634349608001", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/9147142897/#comment72157634350001861", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1372318728", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/51979177@N02] Ahem!
