Kurana was delivered to ANA in December 1937, and would serve ANA until September 11, 1939 when it was briefly impressed into RAAF service wearing the serial A30-2 while flying with 8 Squadron.  Kurana was returned to ANA service in February 1940.  She would serve with ANA until November 8, 1948.  On that date while flying from Melbourne-Essendon to Denilquin, the aircraft was seen passing Mount Macedon township at low altitude. The aircraft then struck cloud-covered Mount Macedon near the summit.  While 19 passengers survived the crash, sadly, both the pilot and co-pilot perished.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "29361615-4414885081-72157623583865624", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4414885081/#comment72157623465111299", "realname": "Francisco Arag\u00e3o", "path_alias": "aragao", "author": "11155634@N07", "iconserver": "5500", "datecreate": "1268189258", "_content": "wonderful image !!!!!", "authorname": "Francisco Arag\u00e3o", "id": "29361615-4414885081-72157623465111299", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4414885081/#comment72157623622004860", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "87367694@N00", "iconserver": "7127", "datecreate": "1268618949", "_content": "Love the view of Melbourne!", "authorname": "Lulybelle", "id": "29361615-4414885081-72157623622004860", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4414885081/#comment72157624011507441", "realname": "", "path_alias": "jamica1", "author": "35607158@N06", "iconserver": "5479", "datecreate": "1274817866", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1377649@N22/\">Science, Technology, History</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "jamica1", "id": "29361615-4414885081-72157624011507441", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4414885081/#comment72157624678975070", "realname": "", "path_alias": "savageartsphotography", "author": "44418882@N07", "iconserver": "4078", "datecreate": "1281271478", "_content": "This looks like a shot by Margaret B White", "authorname": "JenniferSavage", "id": "29361615-4414885081-72157624678975070", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4414885081/#comment72157625125947856", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "74784995@N00", "iconserver": "2868", "datecreate": "1286629807", "_content": "This was a Wright Cyclone powered civilian DC-3 like the majority built before World War II (not powered by P&amp;W Twin Wasps)...and strictly not a Dakota or 'Gooney Bird'", "authorname": "A30yoyo", "id": "29361615-4414885081-72157625125947856", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4414885081/#comment72157628210550511", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "13922436@N06", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1322601717", "_content": "How many passengers did this plane hold when it air-lifted missionaries and others out of Lae and Port Moresby, New Guinea Dec. 26, 1941?  Our great-aunt was on the plane, weighing 86 pounds and nigh 68 years old.  She had been living in huts up in the Rawlinson Range collecting plants, was full of worms, and nearly starving. On the first flight she vomited and then vomited some more, on the second flight, she was more fortunate.  Perhaps the evacuation to Cairns and then to Brisbane saved her life.  Her name was Mary Strong Clemens. Read about her on line.  She writes of the plane trip in her journal which was on her lap with 3 books.
