If you are familiar with the Sydney newspapers of the late 1850s and early 1860s these are perhaps the first people you'd think of when you come across a mid 19th century reference to 'Mr and Mrs Poole'. If you search the digitised newspapers you can see just how prominent they were during this period.\n\nPer a brief obit item which appeared in the Argus on 21 February, 1872, p.5 (column d), Charles Poole died at Boston, in the US, in December 1871 - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page231886\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page231886</a> . Per this item, Poole and his wife appear to have moved to the US in the later 1860s. If this were theatre manager Charles Poole and his actor/director wife, I suspect that the pic might have in fact been taken in the early to mid 1860s. \n\nQuite a bit of speculation here though!!!\n\nPS - It's interesting that this pic should appear in a sequence of theatre pics. Is that just a co-incidence?", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-3273931356-72157629097675155", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3273931356/#comment72157629107431727", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1327973099", "_content": "Hi quasymody,\nThe Holtermann collection is a document of ordinary working people on the goldfields of central New South Wales in the first half of the 1870's. Whoever this couple was they were not Charles Poole and his wife. She is probably pregnant so they are only young. They are in their best clothes but you can see from the shabbiness and his rough boots that he is probably a miner or shopowner in those goldfields boom towns like Hill End or Gulgong.
