[BY TELEGRAPH] SYDNEY, Wednesday.  \nAn accident, involving some \u00a3200 damage, occurred on Thursday evening at the Zig-Zag, near Lithgow, to a goods train from Penrith. The train was descending the top line incline, and when the Westinghouse brakes were applied they refused to act. As a result the engine was impelled forward at terrific speed until it struck the end of the length upon which trains back up to enable them to run on to a different track. Here five feet of solid cut-out rock was encountered, and, having demolished the strong buffer stops, the engine bounded up on to the rock ledge, on the other side of which was a deep chasm. A truck next the engine mounted the tender by the force of the impact, and became a total wreck; the next truck also left the rails, but the remainder of the train kept its position. Beyond shock, the driver and fireman received no injuries. A departmental inquiry completed yesterday afternoon shows\nthat the derailment of the engine was due to the injudicious use of the brake, which resulted in the train getting beyond control.&quot; - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/44293278\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barrier Miner, Wednesday 10 April 1901, p. 2.</a>\n\nA view from the other side confirms the engine number to be 246\n<a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/photo.asp?17420_a014_a014000988\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/BOSImages/Series/0017/420/Items/0222/475/17420_a014_a014000988.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"75\" /></a>\nDerailment on the Zig Zag at Lithgow (04/04/1901) [SRNSW: 17420_a014_a014000988]", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "29361615-3883631824-72157626023427060", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3883631824/#comment72157627049889460", "realname": "Andrey Timofeev", "path_alias": "timodrey", "author": "60866881@N08", "iconserver": "3816", "datecreate": "1309084901", "_content": "oi", "authorname": "Andrey Timofeev", "id": "29361615-3883631824-72157627049889460", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "3883631824"}, "flarchive:created": 1389607672}
