It consists of one grand central opening by a depth of thirty feet, twenty-five feet wide, with wing openings eleven feet wide, capped with three gold-painted domes on pediments, with crown pediments.  The central dome rising seventy-nine feet and the wing domes forty feet each, with telescope flagstaffs, thirty-five and twenty-five feet higher.  The circular dome is pierced with twelve circular openings, each of which contains a letter of the name &quot;Alfred&quot; prepared for illumination.  The interior of the central dome and wings to be lighted with three massive chandeliers.  The ceiling of the wings consist of paper centreflowers with spandrils and cornices.  The ceiling of the central dome rises on ribs enlivened with tropical foliage on a ground of sunset tint, a rose colour from a neat cornice picked out in colour.  Painted on the interior of the central dome are figures of Fame bearing wreaths of laurel on a ground of azure, dressings of flags artistically arranged, the groups of Neptune and Minerva on the central key-stones, and the busts of Captain Cook and Lord Nelson on the central niches.  Over the central dome floated the Royal Standard, and over the wing domes the blue and white ensigns. ... &quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-5760146474-72157626684536785", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5760146474/#comment72157626809559668", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1306407776", "_content": "A description of the illuminations at night from the same newspaper (under 'Circular Quay') - \n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13160161\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13160161</a>\n\n&quot; The illuminations of the triumphal arch under which the Prince received the address from the Corporation of Sydney on landing, was one of the most splendid features of the illuminated city.  From base to dome it was one blaze of light.  It was surmounted by stars in gas jets, seven feet by four in dimension.  Beneath the stars, but above the dome were wreaths of fire, and the name of the Prince was beautifully lighted up, and was clearly visible a long distance.  The two smaller domes were also encircled by wreaths of lighted gas jets.  The cornices of the arch were defined by lines of fire, and the words &quot;Welcome Prince Alfred&quot; were clearly defined in variegated lamps.  An immense chandelier was suspended from the centre of the large arch, and a small one from each of the wings.  On the parapet were pots of fire, which burned with a steady light throughout the early part of the night.  The gorgeous spectacle which this arch presented was the theme of universal admiration. &quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-5760146474-72157626809559668", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5760146474/#comment72157626691850671", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1306490993", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/beachcomberaustralia] That's what I call adding value!
