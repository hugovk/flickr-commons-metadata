In 1912, he was awarded a gold medal for jumping over a sequence of 14 chairs and three hurdles 3'9'' high (1.14 metres) placed along the line. As he cleared the last hurdle, he rotated his body to land on the backward roll. Buchner's enlargement was probably used in the foyer of the Royal Roller Rink at Moore Park, where Lewis was assistant manager.
