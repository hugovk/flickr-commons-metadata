The Manly ferries had white trim on their hulls both before and after WWII. Their hulls were painted all the one colour (some say grey, others green) as a wartime measure from 1942 to 1946/47. In this picture, below the bollard with lines (ropes) to the wharf, there is no white band running along the hull, so I would say the picture is within the period 1942 to 1946.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "29361615-6184464208-72157627725816461", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/6184464208/#comment72157627865947570", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1318293292", "_content": "Thanks GrenadierGuardsDmr, we're not sure about this one.

The jetty deck at Manly was (and still is) much wider than Circular Quay and therefore the passenger shelter was much further back from the jetty edge on both sides of the jetty. Also the bell from ex Manly ferry P.S. Brighton (top left corner of the photo) was fixed to the end of the jetty at Circular Quay, rung when departure was due. \nAs for the date, I'm now not sure. The Manly ferries had &quot;pinstripes&quot;, painted line highlights right around the hull just above the sponson (the timber buffer). Before the war these pinstripes were yellow (they are shown as yellow on the coloured pre-war tram posters of Curl Curl, and the later edition showing South Steyne), during the war they seem to have been either still yellow or painted over in the drab green colour applied to the entire hull. After the war they were bright white. Unfortunately this golden yellow is a very hard colour to pick in black and white photos, particularly when on applied metal strips standing proud of the hull and catching the light, and so this photo may show the yellow or drab colour on the pinstripe. The photo may be 1940.\nHowever, I viewed this print a couple of years ago at the Mitchell Library and it had a date note on the back &quot;16/11/48&quot;. Was that a reference to acquisition?\nRgds.", "authorname": "GrenadierGuardsDmr", "id": "29361615-6184464208-72157637625236996", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/6184464208/#comment72157637645555156", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1384382836", "_content": "Hi GrenadierGuardsmr, I checked with our dress historian and it is 1939-1940, definitely no later than 1945, so the 1948 date must be our acquisition date RW", "authorname": "State Library of New South Wales collection", "id": "29361615-6184464208-72157637645555156", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "6184464208"}, "flarchive:created": 1389893288}
