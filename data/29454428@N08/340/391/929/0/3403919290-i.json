The three gold, won by cyclist Edgar &quot;Dunc&quot; Gray, rower Henry &quot;Bobby&quot; Pearce and teenage swimmer Clare Dennis, matched the record total from Paris in 1924. The silver medal was won by swimmer Philomena &quot;Bonnie&quot; Mealing in the women's 100m backstroke, while Eddie Scarf's bronze in freestyle wrestling was the first Australian medal in the sport.\n \nThe Sydney 2000 Olympic velodrome was named in Dunc Gray's honour.\n\nClare Dennis was the youngest woman to win a gold medal in Los Angeles, aged 16.\n\nThe Australian flag at the Opening Ceremony was carried by swimming legend Andrew &quot;Boy&quot; Charlton. However, unlike the previous two Games of 1924 and 1928, Charlton did not win a medal in Los Angeles, his performance affected by illness.\n\nAustralia competed in five sports in Los Angeles: aquatics (swimming), athletics, cycling, rowing and wrestling. Of these, athletics was the only sport in which no medal was won. The team was small as amateur athletes earnt little money and the travelling expenses from Australia were always high because of distance.\nReference: Australian Olympic Committee website\n\nFormat: Photograph\n \nNotes: Find more detailed information about this photograph: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=430692\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=430692</a>\n\nSearch for more great images in the State Library's collections: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n \nFrom the collection of the State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "5757", "farm": 4, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1932-01-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1384760412", "takengranularity": "6", "posted": "1238566362"}, "originalsecret": "7119bb655a", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "3612", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3403919290/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389897957}
