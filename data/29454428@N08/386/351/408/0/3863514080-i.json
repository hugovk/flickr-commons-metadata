Flagstad was the most celebrated Wagnerian soprano but Lawrence's young and passionate voice was greatly admired. On 1st January 1936, Lawrence astounded the crew and audience by actually riding the warhorse into the &quot;flames&quot; at the climax of Gotterdammerung, the final opera in Wagner's cycle, despite instruction she was not to do so. Wagner had intended this stage business but Lawrence was probably the first to attempt it, as she had ridden since childhood in the Australian bush. Coincidentally, this performance was recorded and is the only complete recording of Gotterdammerung with Lauritz Melchior, the most famous Siegfried ever.\nIn 1941 Lawrence contracted polio ending her first career. Her second career was achieved through seated concert performances or a few roles like Princess Amneris in Aida where it was feasible to remain seated. The many recordings left of her show she was one of the great Wagnerian singers.\n\nFormat: Negative\n\nFrom the collections of the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>\n\nInformation about photographic collections of the State Library of New South Wales: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n\nPersistent url: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=27051\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=27051</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4477", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1944-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1382784084", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1251413855"}, "originalsecret": "f0c5a053b2", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2538", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3863514080/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607677}
