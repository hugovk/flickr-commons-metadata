She and Frida Leider were considered the two greats of the 1920's. Unfortunately she didn't have an established career at Covent Garden which restricted her renown, although she left 102 recordings of her warm but majestic voice.\nIn Berlin in 1930, she showed the first signs of multiple sclerosis. Her career afterwards consisted of more concert and recording work, also entertaining the troops during the War. After the War Austral was a teacher at the Newcastle Conservatorium of Music, New South Wales. Regarded by many as Australia's greatest singer.\n\nFormat: Negative\n\nFrom the collections of the Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>\n\nInformation about photographic collections of the State Library of New South Wales: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n\nPersistent url: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=31505\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=31505</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "3984", "farm": 3, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2006-05-31 13:13:54", "lastupdate": "1385063585", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1251433142"}, "originalsecret": "361b59be49", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "2652", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3864186278/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607675}
