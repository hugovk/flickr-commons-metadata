Sold directly to upper end golf courses, these machines would payout in golf balls rather than money. \n\nMills modified the cabinet of one of their existing slot machines to hold golf balls and dispense them at the bottom.

It has a wood cabinet with hand painted green trim. <i>&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.nationsattic.com/antiqueslotmachineforsale.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nation's Attic</a></i>\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29361615-8965096671-72157633962380110", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8965096671/#comment72157633959862283", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1370496303", "_content": "Indeed it is.
