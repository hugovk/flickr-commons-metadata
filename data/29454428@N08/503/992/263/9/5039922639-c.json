It was not the Indian national team as such. The tour was sponsored by the Nawab of Manavadar, who was himself a player of note.

At the time Manavadar were one of the leading Indian teams.\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team were Olympic champions from 1928-1956. Throughout this period they had some fantastic players, including 'Player of the Century' Dhayan Chand (1906-1979), who represented India at the 1928, 1932 and 1936 Olympics. One of their notable wins was in the final at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, where they beat home team Germany 8-1, with Hitler watching on. \n\nThere's a good pic of the 1938 Manavadar team taken in Wellington, New Zealand at - <a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23205598\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23205598</a> and an action shot <a href=\"http://beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23127438\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta.natlib.govt.nz/records/23127438</a> \n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Australian and New Zealand hockey teams were not competitive at an international level, with the result that the visiting Indian teams won most of the games they played, in many instances by large margins.\n\nNote that the State Library of NSW web-site has several other pics of this 1938 Manavadar team (links above), and also several pics of the 'all-India' team which toured New Zealand and Australia in 1935...including this pic of Indian captain Dhayan Chand, taken in Sydney in August 1935 - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=81891\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=81891</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-5039922639-72157629051501063", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5039922639/#comment72157629054144267", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1327674102", "_content": "Since writing the above I've found Geoff Watson's excellent 2005 article on the Indian hockey tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s and 1930s - <a href=\"http://www.hockeynz.co.nz/documents/ASSH article 2004 amended.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.hockeynz.co.nz/documents/ASSH%20article%202004%20amen...</a>        The names of ?some players in this photograph can be established via one of the pics in Watson's article.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-5039922639-72157629054144267", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5039922639/#comment72157632816563710", "realname": "", "path_alias": "vercettisworld", "author": "14343849@N05", "iconserver": "8323", "datecreate": "1361389178", "_content": "Snazzy duds!", "authorname": "GregHausM.D.", "id": "29361615-5039922639-72157632816563710", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "5039922639"}, "flarchive:created": 1389893964}
