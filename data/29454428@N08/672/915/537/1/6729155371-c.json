It was home for approximately 1100 people, many of Scots ancestry, and was connected to the nearby town of Mittagong by a narrow gauge railway that terminated adjacent to the main Southern Railway line in Mittagong. The town existed to mine shale from which kerosene was extracted by the Australian Kerosene Oil and Mineral Co. The process was superseded by conventional kerosene production from oil and the shale mining technique became uneconomical. By 1911, the town had become deserted as inhabitants relocated in search of work.\n\nSituated in a deep valley, the town had limited access by road but this has improved in the last thirty years although much of the access road is unsealed. There are the remains of the old school, the mine, houses and retorts and several graves.", "authorname": "Reynardo", "id": "29361615-6729155371-72157628948685267", "iconfarm": 2}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/6729155371/#comment72157628950533379", "realname": "Ian Sutton", "path_alias": null, "author": "22616984@N07", "iconserver": "7359", "datecreate": "1327049432", "_content": "<a href=\"http://www.ashadocs.org/aha/13/13_04_Jack.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">1877.
