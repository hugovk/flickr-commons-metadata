A grant of land to the School of Arts resulted in premises being built by 1861 on the corner of Howick and William Streets on land adjoining the Church of England's All Saints Cathedral. It was a two storey building designed by local architect, M.H. Sadlier. A long-desired public hall was completed in 1874, helping boost the membership to 324 people (Bialowas, 2000, 35, 39-40).\n\nDuring the 1870s the School of Arts received an annual grant from the Government on the understanding that 'the institution should tend to the intellectual advancement of the people'. Early accounts of the lectures and discussions suggest that entertainments were many and varied, including: lectures, tea-drinkings, readings, soirees, bazaars, an occasional circus, 'biological-phenomena', mesmerism, and phrenology. The courses of lectures were on occasion ambitious and expensive (Greaves, 1961).&quot; - source: <a href=\"http://www.visit.heritage.nsw.gov.au/16_subnav_09_2.cfm?itemid=5053088\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heritage Council of NSW</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "29361615-5134972376-72157625168585699", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5134972376/#comment72157625168686549", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1288664407", "_content": "A description of the interior of the buildings ...\n\n&quot;Fronting Howick and William streets are the School of Arts premises, which have been erected at a cost of \u00a311,000. Between two shops on the ground floor, in William-street, an entrance leads upstairs to a reading-room, well supplied with the leading colonial, intercolonial, and English newspapers. The room is about to be enlarged. Behind the reading-room is a library containing over 6000 volumes of books. The shelves are supplemented by a regular monthly supply from England, the books being specially rebound in half-roan - an admirable arrangement, which materially contributes to their preservation. Behind the library is the great hall, which is the finest in the colony. Its length over all is 120 feet by 45 feet; inside the platform the dimensions are 75 by 45. It will easily accommodate 1000 people, and half as many more have on occasions been packed into it. The platform is fitted up with a proscenium; behind are retiring rooms, and beneath is a large supper room. The acoustic properties of the hall are unfortunately defective, and an attempt is to be made to improve them.&quot; - source: <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/13464649\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday 24 July 1880, p. 3.</a>", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "29361615-5134972376-72157625168686549", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5134972376/#comment72157625295098914", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1288686945", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pellethepoet] Golly you have been busy.
