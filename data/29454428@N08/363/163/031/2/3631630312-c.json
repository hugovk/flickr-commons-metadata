I'd say that in 1928 their inspiration might have been Mussolini rather than Hitler. At the time Hitler was still an obscure fringe political figure, and in Italy, provided you weren't a leftist, ordinary people still probably had little idea of the true nature of Mussolini's regime. So I wouldn't rush to read too much into an ?Italian opera troupe giving the fascist salute in 1928. If it was 1938, then different story.
