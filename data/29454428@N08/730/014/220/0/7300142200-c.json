The clock on the tower indicates 7:25 (PM), which would be 10:25 AM in Westminster Abby -- the Queen was to arrive at 11:00am.  The BBC provided seven hours of live coverage -- which in 1953 was unparalleled.\n\nThe present Rockdale Town Hall was designed by architect Douglas Babbington Gardiner and built in 1940, replacing the original hall designed by William Kenwood. The hall has been the site of many important public occasions, and is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.  It continues to serve today as the Town Hall and Library. <i>&mdash;Excerpted</i>&nbsp;[<a href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2330157\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b025t5zb\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2309793/The-Queen-asked-Ready-girls-The-Coronation-maids-honour-reunite-60-years-share-memories-day.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a>] [<a href=\"http://guides.naa.gov.au/royalty-australian-society/chapter8/index.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a>]\n\n&nbsp;\n<b>Rockdale Town Hall &ndash; Then and Now</b> (&lt;60 years later)\n&nbsp;\n&quot;Rockdale Town Hall, Sydney, 1953&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Rockdale Town Hall &amp; Library (2012)&quot; by <i>Steve</i>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/74004041@N06/8130017580/\" title=\"Coronation celebrations, Rockdale Town Hall, Sydney, 1953 / photographer Australian Photographic Agency by State Library of New South Wales collection, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7215/7300142200_e764e61836_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"185\" alt=\"Coronation celebrations, Rockdale Town Hall, Sydney, 1953 / photographer Australian Photographic Agency\" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/74004041@N06/8130017580/\" title=\"Rockdale Town Hall and Library by Walkingalongthetrail on Flickr\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8466/8130017580_8d9697096e_z.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"185\" alt=\"Rockdale Town Hall\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29361615-7300142200-72157634031008013", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "7300142200"}, "flarchive:created": 1389605418}
