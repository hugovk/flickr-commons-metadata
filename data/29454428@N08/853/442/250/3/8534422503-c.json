I've visited the Queen Mary many years. There are tours and small museum aspects of the ship but, she's mainly an event location and Hotel. Such a beautiful ship, so glad we have this vessel with it's rich history in Long Beach.\n\nAs a side note, there's word of the ship receiving a gray coat of primer in preparations to repaint the entire ship. So, for a limited time, she'll be gray just as she was during her service during the war. :-)", "authorname": "worldsfair39", "id": "29361615-8534422503-72157632944726358", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8534422503/#comment72157632951740802", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1362778433", "_content": "majestic!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "29361615-8534422503-72157632951740802", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8534422503/#comment72157632986070326", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1363153849", "_content": "Yes I visited the Queen Mary at Long Beach in 1979 just after my father died. He had travelled around the world in her, and the Queen Elizabeth in World War II as part of the Royal Australian Air Force, sent first to Canada for training, then England and then Asia. I had the ship to myself and saw no other tourists that morning, unbelievably. An incredible and moving visit to one of the two ships whose transport of troops shortened the war.

To walk the decks without seeing any other guests. The Queen Mary is the only example of Cunard history we have today. All others are gone. The Queen Elizabeth was a victim of questionable circumstances in the 70s. She was originally planned to be docked not far from the Mary from what I understand. \n\nThe Queen Mary has been a victim of poor maintenance, bad management and continuous &quot;band-aids&quot; to rust issues and other stages of decay. It wasn't till recently that the sun deck, and promenade decks have been refurbished. The Observation Bar has undergone a few refurbishments and is beginning to look closer to her original 1936 appearance. With luck, dedication, discipline and money, she'll be spared for another 77 years! :D", "authorname": "worldsfair39", "id": "29361615-8534422503-72157632984849631", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8534422503/#comment72157637211326316", "realname": "Frank Tavares", "path_alias": "oneofall1", "author": "52341214@N02", "iconserver": "5048", "datecreate": "1383365688", "_content": "One of the tool pushers at times would yell This here isn' The queen Marie on a offshore drilling platform called The Ocean Ranger", "authorname": "mobileoneofall", "id": "29361615-8534422503-72157637211326316", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8534422503/#comment72157638267552586", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mistersable", "author": "51809917@N00", "iconserver": "7394", "datecreate": "1385954616", "_content": "The Observation Bar will never look like it did in the 30's until they get rid of those gawdawful sports playing wide-screen televisions.
