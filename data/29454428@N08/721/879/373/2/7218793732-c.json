It includes a pic of the NSW Governor Sir Dudley de Chair and other VIPs on the dais and also a pic of the foundation stone <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16194943\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16194943</a> There are numerous pics of this 1925 ceremony in the various collections, eg.  <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=44265\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au//item/itemLarge.aspx?itemID=44265</a> ; <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8725000050r.jpg&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a>\n\nNow, hidden away in the maze that is NSW Transport RMS (is that still their name this week?) there's a further pic which also appears to have been taken on the same occasion as this SLNSW pic...this NSW Transport RMS pic is particularly significant because it shows the inscription on the block...I'm trying to discover how to link to this pic...the link dies once the session times out...this (maybe!) gets you to the NSW Transport RMS photo library front door <a href=\"http://www.rtaphotolibrary.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.rtaphotolibrary.com.au</a> ...then either search for this pic 19250326HB001.jpg or key in 'de chair'\n\nA quick trawl thru the digitised newspapers reveals that this block is a second commemorative stone which was temporarily parked on a pedestal on the Harbour Bridge site in 1925 and then in 1927 was set in place on one of the southern pylons at Dawes Point...as this this 1927 SMH news item explains - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16371496\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16371496</a> ; accompanying pic - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16371276\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16371276</a>\n\nHere's the stone as it appears in situ <a href=\"http://www.photosau.com.au/cos/scripts/ExtSearch.asp?SearchTerm=047617\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.photosau.com.au/cos/scripts/ExtSearch.asp?SearchTerm=...</a>\n\nNote that the caption accompanying the NSW Transport RMS pic suggests it was taken on 26/3/1925, which is the date of the inscription on the block...but if we look at the numerous pics of the proceedings at the laying of the Harbour Bridge foundation stone on 26/3/1925, we can see that de Chair was dressed in his naval uniform that day, not in a suit and winter overcoat and hat as we see in this SLNSW pic...so I'd say we're looking at a different day altogether...and probably sometime in winter \n\nNow here's the puzzle. Initially I thought that this SLNSW pic might have been taken at the stone setting ceremony at the southern pylon on 21/6/1927....however, over at SRNSW they have a couple of pics of that ceremony...and as is evident, they don't match up with this pic! <a href=\"http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.asp?digitalid=12685_a007_a00704_8727000159r.JPG&amp;B1=Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/asp/photosearch/search.as...</a>\n\nAs thing stand, my guess is that in this SLNSW pic we see the stone either on its temporary pedestal...or maybe in the process of being moved into position at the southern pylon...on the day of the 1927 ceremony...the fact that de Chair is holding a trowel tends to suggest that some kind of official stone setting was in train...this one might require a visit to a library...work in progress", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-7218793732-72157632498321963", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/7218793732/#comment72157632509958144", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1358060308", "_content": "Here's the Lang ministry at the time of the 1927 stone setting ceremony - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1213589\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1213589</a> ; You can read about them on the former member pages here... <a href=\"http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/Archives_MemberPage\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/web/common.nsf/key/Archive...</a> ; some additional mug-shots appear here <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16390278\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16390278</a> ;\n\nThe only 'possibles' from this lot that I can tentatively identify are Public Works and Railways Secretary Bill Ratcliffe (possibly the gent to the left of de Chair) <a href=\"http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6ebed995667c2ca256ea100825164/485900c07ad2b648ca256e52000922ad?OpenDocument\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6e...</a> and Labour and Industry Secretary R.W.
