It was never planned as a department store. Instead it was an imaginative concept for the 'trading post'. York Street was the traditional heart of the softgoods trade where buyers scampered through to the great warehouse that dominated the street. The Grace Building was to offer facilities for buyers and sellers to meet and discuss samples.&quot; Indeed, it was generally thought that on the completion of the Harbour Bridge and the city railway that York Street would become one of the principal retail thoroughfares of the city, rivalling the supremacy of George and Pitt streets and pushing out the wholesalers in the area. The ground and first floors of the Grace Building were, however, fitted out as retail areas where home furnishings were sold. Expansive glazed shop windows invited the gaze of passersby and doors on each street invited them to enter. &quot;", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-4226045829-72157622979412033", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4226045829/#comment72157622980775421", "realname": "", "path_alias": "orlandosydney", "author": "38772536@N03", "iconserver": "3746", "datecreate": "1262234842", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1237035@N24/\">Sydney in B&amp;W and Monochromatic tones</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "O-Sydney", "id": "29361615-4226045829-72157622980775421", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4226045829/#comment72157623028438929", "realname": "", "path_alias": "derdraht", "author": "29634931@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1262795832", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1015395@N21/\">Wir haben`s schwarz auf weiss ONLY THE BEST IN B&amp;W  ART\u2665 \u2665</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!\n\nGREAT shot", "authorname": "das auge ! off", "id": "29361615-4226045829-72157623028438929", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4226045829/#comment72157623194869756", "realname": "carlosbezz", "path_alias": "artlandstudio", "author": "22694125@N02", "iconserver": "7427", "datecreate": "1263299472", "_content": "Hi, I'm an admin for a group called <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1225214@N25/\">artland</a>, and we'd love to have this added to the group!", "authorname": "artland", "id": "29361615-4226045829-72157623194869756", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4226045829/#comment72157623070622195", "realname": "Louise Evangelista", "path_alias": "___louise", "author": "43274874@N02", "iconserver": "4023", "datecreate": "1263302428", "_content": "amazing.", "authorname": "___Louise", "id": "29361615-4226045829-72157623070622195", "iconfarm": 5}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4226045829/#comment72157625371937336", "realname": "Giovanni Portelli", "path_alias": "thepretenda", "author": "49503205104@N01", "iconserver": "1", "datecreate": "1289622776", "_content": "what a great looking building!", "authorname": "thepretenda", "id": "29361615-4226045829-72157625371937336", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4226045829/#comment72157626278105937", "realname": "", "path_alias": "meandboo", "author": "46206853@N03", "iconserver": "4050", "datecreate": "1301625657", "_content": "They don't build 'em like they used to!", "authorname": "Me And Boo", "id": "29361615-4226045829-72157626278105937", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "4226045829"}, "flarchive:created": 1389607411}
