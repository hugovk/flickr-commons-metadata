She arrived in Kronstadt on 20 May 1902, receiving Tsar Nicholas II for lunch aboard on the 23rd. Montcalm took part in the Australian capture of Rabaul in September 1914, details in the Australian Official History of the 1914-18 War, Volume Ten. There was some comment on the profile of the ship, bows and stern sections effectively identical, it being thought that this was an attempt to confuse enemy range-finders.\nShe later cruised in the China Sea,[disambiguation needed] notably ferrying Marshal Joseph Joffre in November 1921.\nShe was decommissioned on the 28 October 1926 and used as a school ship hulk, Tremintin, in 1934. She was still docked in Brest in 1940 and was destroyed during the Occupation in 1943. &quot;\n</blockquote>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-10033994675-72157636080859403", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/10033994675/#comment72157636100181754", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1380668424", "_content": "Most of the mentions in Trove talk of a visit in 1911,  unless this occasion was hushed up due to the war.\nHmmm ??\n\nPossibly this ? - SMH 23/1/1911 p.4 - <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15246732\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/15246732</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-10033994675-72157636100181754", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/10033994675/#comment72157636100630215", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1380670584", "_content": "Thanks, beachcomberaustralia", "authorname": "State Library of New South Wales collection", "id": "29361615-10033994675-72157636100630215", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/10033994675/#comment72157636562617343", "realname": "Peter D.
