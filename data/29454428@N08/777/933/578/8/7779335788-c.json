The Ossetians are from Iran and most Iranians I know only  look like Sephardic Jews, but not that much, due to intermarrying with Greeks--they don't look Semitic, usually. Also, Iranian migration to places like Australia wasn't much until around 1980, after the Revolution.\n\nAs for Jews, most of those who emigrated to Australia were Ashkenazi Jews (those who had settled in Europe and Russia) and would have been lighter of hair and skin due to assimilation with Norther Europeans and Slavs. The Sephardic population (from Asia and north Africa) is minimal in Australia. There were only a little over 5,000 Jews in 1861 and most of those were Ashkenazi.\n\nMy bet is that they are Maori. These people look well off, which would track with the preferential treatment given to Maori, compared to indigenous Australians. \n\nFor more on this: \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_in_Australia\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_in_Australia</a>\n\nDo you know the Kiwi actor Cliff Curtis?  He played Pablo Escobar in &quot;Blow&quot; and looked so much like the Colombian drug lord it's unbelievable. These people also look part Hispanic, part South American Indian, so maybe they're also Maori, like Curtis. \n\nFor a photo of him, check out this link:\n<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193295/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.imdb.com/name/nm0193295/</a>\n\nInteresting puzzle!", "authorname": "GregHausM.D.", "id": "29361615-7779335788-72157631667778144", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/7779335788/#comment72157631672862692", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1349156847", "_content": "Sorry Greg, definitely a Jewish family.
