Saxton &amp; Sons' saw mill and timber warehouse at Pyrmont. Photographer Sam Hood would have known A.C. Saxton, who was a 1920s Sydney yachting identity...in 1926 Saxton was hit by a beam during a race off Newport and fell overboard...per the newspaper report of the incident, he appears to have either been killed by the blow or drowned...during the attempt to rescue him, his body was initially recovered but was then lost in rough seas...quite a tragedy all up...I'd say Hood would have known the sons, who carried on the timber business after their father's death...I gather A.C. Saxton &amp; Sons were located at Bridge and Abattoir Rds...(Abattoir Rd was later renamed Bank St)...given the development in the area since the 1930s, I don't think we'd be able to do a 'now and then' via Google street view...though whether my initial guess re the location has legs is a rather big 'if'.\n\nRegardless, I want a pair of those shorts the chaps in front are wearing...looks like they were a 'one size fits all' model...", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-9610489593-72157637396357525", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/9610489593/#comment72157637400718484", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1383798356", "_content": "Hi again, quasymody! I think you're right and you had to have room to grow into those pants as they had to last you such a long time! You're also probably right about the Pyrmont location.
