(See Appendix 1 for a full list of Senators and Members in 1927.) There were 36 Senators and 76 Members. The Nationalist/Country Party Coalition was in Government and clearly had the numbers (see Appendices 13 and 14 showing party affiliation) in both Houses. The Parliament consisted only of men and it was another 16 years before the first woman was elected. (Dame Enid Lyons was elected to the seat of Darwin [Tasmania] in 1943). Their salary was 1000 per annum and there was no general change in that salary until 1947, when it was increased by 500. (In fact during the Great Depression politicians salaries were reduced. In 1932 they received 750 per annum and it was not until 1938 that they were restored to their 1927 level.)\n\nThe politicians who took their seats in 1927 were a diverse lot (except that they were all male). There were 34 New South Welshmen (28 MHRs and 6 Senators); 26 Victorians (20 and 6); 16 Queenslanders (10 and 6); 11 Western Australians (5 and 6); 12 South Australians (7 and 6); 11 Tasmanians (5 and 6) and 1 from the Northern Territory. There were 29 farmers, graziers and pastoralists; 15 lawyers; 6 miners; 6 journalists and 4 school teachers. The average age of the MHRs was 52 compared with 56 in the Senate. The youngest Member was Roland Green, 32 (Richmond, NSW), who had lost a leg in the Great War. The oldest Member was John West (East Sydney NSW), 76, a plumber by occupation. Eighty three of the 112 Members were born in Australia and the remainder were born in either New Zealand or the United Kingdom. Thirty per cent of Members had a secondary education and 22 per cent had a tertiary qualification.(32)\n\nReference:\nParliament of Australia website. <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.aph.gov.au/</a> (accessed May 20, 2011)", "authorname": "State Library of New South Wales collection", "id": "29361615-5735409371-72157626760658780", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5735409371/#comment72157626801240032", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1306306858", "_content": "I misread this at first as &quot;Politicians lolling on grass&quot;.  \nI hope they didn't inhale!", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-5735409371-72157626801240032", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5735409371/#comment72157626801347544", "realname": "Greg Miles", "path_alias": "gregbm", "author": "75299599@N00", "iconserver": "76", "datecreate": "1306308417", "_content": "The information is just as interesting as the photograph!", "authorname": "Greg Miles", "id": "29361615-5735409371-72157626801347544", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5735409371/#comment72157627637677816", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1315666370", "_content": "who's the Indian ?", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "29361615-5735409371-72157627637677816", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5735409371/#comment72157629027041423", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1327506837", "_content": "Can anyone identify the politicians? Are they politicians or are they members of the press corps? I initially thought that the Indian gentleman sipping tea might have been Dewan Bahadur T.

Shanmukham Chetty...really should have worked this out before now...my excuse is...if you've maybe read a few books about the Indian independence movement...well, chances are you'll have learned a little about the big part players...figures such as C.R. Das, Motilal and Jarwaharwal Nehru, Jinnah, Gandhi and maybe one or two others. But you probably won't know much about the thousands of lesser players...particularly the so-called 'loyal' nationalists, such as Shanmukham Chetty, who in the 1920s-1940s were prepared to participate in constitutional politics and accept the limited level of self-government then on offer...they tend not to rate in the grand narratives...\n\nR.K. Shanmukham Chetty was one of a number of Empire Parliamentary Association delegates who visited Australia in 1926...there are quite a few newspaper items and pics which can be tracked down that provide further info on their visit -  <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38026470\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38026470</a> (at Parliament House, Perth); <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16318817\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16318817</a> (interview with Shanmukham Chetty) ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51369821\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51369821</a> (delegates on tour in Victoria) ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page8799140\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page8799140</a> (delegates at large in Adelaide) ; <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16333355\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16333355</a> (SMH report on the Canberra activities) ; The digitised newspapers also indicate that Shanmukham Chetty visited Australia (and Canberra) in 1941, but I'd say this pic involves his 1926 visit.\n\nWhilst in Canberra, some of the delegates planted trees... <a href=\"http://mildenhall.moadoph.gov.au/photo/2275\" rel=\"nofollow\">mildenhall.moadoph.gov.au/photo/2275</a> ; <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/archivesact/5262589197/in/set-72157625426486897\">www.flickr.com/photos/archivesact/5262589197/in/set-72157...</a> \n\nGiven we now know the location and now the approximate date, it should be easier to sort out who the other chaps in this pic are...the newspaper reports indicate the Empire Parliamentary Association delegates arrived in Canberra on the train from Sydney on the evening of 10 October 1926...and departed on 14 October for Harden...One point we need to keep in mind is that the Australian parliament was located in Melbourne until 1927...I'd say that Canberra wouldn't have exactly been brim full of politicians and department heads and other hangers on at the time this pic was taken. Per the newspaper reports, most of the Australian Cabinet and several members of the Opposition travelled to Canberra specifically to meet with the EPA delegates...the newspaper reports indicate they released some hot air together in the yet to be opened Parliament House...but I haven't been able to identify any of the Cabinet ministers or Opposition members in this pic...\n\n<a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1207563\" rel=\"nofollow\">trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1207563</a> This Canberra Times item gives a more detailed itinerary...it doesn't mention a visit to Lanyon, but I'd say there's little doubt that's where this pic was taken... <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page20360\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-page20360</a> more from the horse's mouth...", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-5735409371-72157634785478763", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5735409371/#comment72157634882169052", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1375312014", "_content": "Thanks again, quasymody!", "authorname": "State Library of New South Wales collection", "id": "29361615-5735409371-72157634882169052", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5735409371/#comment72157634875759769", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1375312936", "_content": "PS quasymody, if it isn't Lanyon, perhaps it is the Campbell's estate which would have been closer to Parliament House?", "authorname": "State Library of New South Wales collection", "id": "29361615-5735409371-72157634875759769", "iconfarm": 9}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5735409371/#comment72157634879316797", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1375339488", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw] I'm not familiar with Campbell's estate...but just from what I know of Lanyon homestead, it certainly looks like that's where this pic was taken... <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanyon_Homestead\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanyon_Homestead</a>\n\nP.S.
