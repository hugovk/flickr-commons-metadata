I'm not 100% sure, but if you zoom in on the version of this pic at the SLNSW, the calendar on the lhs appears to show the page for December 1937. The all-year calendar on the rhs, partly obscures what looks to be the McPherson's logo etc, showing what look's like their Murray Street, Perth address. (McPherson's Ltd were an engineering firm who made pumps, etc). On the top shelf there looks to be a box which might have once contained 'Town Talk' tobacco, which was sold in the 1930s. So my guess is that this pic was taken somewhere in WA in December 1937. Does anyone know where Gnawalda Station was/is?", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-3562424230-72157629151396489", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3562424230/#comment72157634735092418", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1374420375", "_content": "Gnawalda certainly sounds like a west australian word.", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "29361615-3562424230-72157634735092418", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "3562424230"}, "flarchive:created": 1389894877}
