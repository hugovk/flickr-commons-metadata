She became a long distance swimmer and made a career of her swimming and diving show on stage and later in films. Her arrest in Boston in 1907 for wearing an &quot;indecent&quot; one piece swimming costume helped change the law for swimwear. Esther Williams later made a film based on her life called Million Dollar Mermaid and made her own career in aquatic entertainment on film.\n\nFormat: Photographic postcard\n \nNotes: Find more detailed information about this photographic collection: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=889225\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=889225</a>\n\nSearch for more great images in the State Library's collections: <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/SimpleSearch.aspx</a>\n \nFrom the collection of the State Library of New South Wales <a href=\"http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sl.nsw.gov.au</a>"}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "4073", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "1920-00-01 00:00:00", "lastupdate": "1377402757", "takengranularity": "8", "posted": "1268614990"}, "originalsecret": "7f18ae822f", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4010", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/4434063362/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389607241}
