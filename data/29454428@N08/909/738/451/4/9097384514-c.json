The statue was erected to commemorate Captain Cook's discovery of the east coast of Australia in 1770. The sculptor was Thomas Woolner (1825-1892) and the statue was cast by Cox &amp; Sons, at its Thames Ditton Foundry, Surrey, England. <i>&mdash;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_Sydney\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a></i>\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29361615-9097384514-72157634242683450", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/9097384514/#comment72157634238734863", "realname": "", "path_alias": "pellethepoet", "author": "47201412@N02", "iconserver": "2683", "datecreate": "1371791859", "_content": "See comments etc. here on this State Records NSW photo -\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/state-records-nsw/4908460523/]", "authorname": "pellethepoet", "id": "29361615-9097384514-72157634238734863", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/9097384514/#comment72157634244741308", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1371798088", "_content": "During his Camden Haven years, poet Henry Kendall contributed a number of satirical witty poems and other items to the Sydney press...some appeared without any name attached (eg. in the Sydney Mail 'Meddler' column), and quite a few appeared in the then liberal Catholic newspaper the Freeman's Journal under the nom 'Mopoke'. One frequent target of Kendall's satire in this period was Sydney lawyer and politician Robert Burdett Smith, who was Kendall's local MLA...this was in the era when politicians didn't actually have to live in the electorate which they represented. As it happened, Smith was also the main shaker and mover on the Cook statue committee, and it was partly due to his efforts that the Cook statue became a reality...which of course didn't impress Kendall, who regarded Smith as an ambitious politician who was more concerned with big noting himself than looking after his electorate. So instead of writing a patriotic poem to celebrate the unveiling of the Cook statue (the kind of verse Kendall was well capable of producing when prize money was on offer), he penned this deeply sarcastic piece titled 'Ode to the Stick Supplanted by Cook's Statue', <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110561539\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110561539</a> ...in the poem Kendall also has a shot at Rev. William Yarrington, whose Wentworth Prize-winning poem 'Cook Meditating on Australia's Future', had been read at the opening of the Great Hall at the University of Sydney in 1859...and was then recycled 20 years later for the unveiling of the Cook statue...in the poem Kendall also reserves a few barbs for John Alexander Dowie and the other extremist Protestant soap-box orators who were active in Hyde Park in the late 1870s...who also became targets of Kendall's satire (eg. in poems such as 'A Hyde Park Larrikin').\n\nWhilst the placement of the Cook statue attracted criticism in some quarters <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107944699\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107944699</a> this appears to have been a minor grumble...all up, the unveiling proved to be a major event which attracted the widespread interest and enthusiasm of the Sydney multitudes...\n\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110562999\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110562999</a>\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28392374\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28392374</a>\n<a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13432417\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13432417</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-9097384514-72157634244741308", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/9097384514/#comment72157634245561712", "realname": "", "path_alias": "beachcomberaustralia", "author": "32162360@N00", "iconserver": "3722", "datecreate": "1371803497", "_content": "At least we know this photo was taken in 1892-3, which might help as a yardstick when trying to date all the other photos of the statue.  \n\nI am (still) very fond of this irreverent description of the statue's history - <a href=\"http://www.publicartaroundtheworld.com/Captain_Cook_Statue_Sydney.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.publicartaroundtheworld.com/Captain_Cook_Statue_Sydne...</a>", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-9097384514-72157634245561712", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/9097384514/#comment72157634254947673", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "71353497@N03", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1371877153", "_content": "Beautiful", "authorname": "qumbranibaloch", "id": "29361615-9097384514-72157634254947673", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/9097384514/#comment72157634729564887", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1374425072", "_content": "Giving the finger in the direction of Hawaii", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "29361615-9097384514-72157634729564887", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "9097384514"}, "flarchive:created": 1389604907}
