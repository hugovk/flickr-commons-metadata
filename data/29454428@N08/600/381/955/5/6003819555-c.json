At each town on the route the marchers shouted &quot;coo-ee&quot; to attract recruits and held recruitment meetings. By the time they reached Sydney just over one month later on 12 November, the numbers had swelled to 263 recruits, marching a total of 320 miles and being welcomed by large crowds along the way.\n \nThe marches were also called &quot;snowball marches&quot; in the hope that like a snowball rolling down a hill will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow as it rolls along, the marchers would also collect more marchers as they progressed to the recruiting depot.\n\n&nbsp;\n<b>E Rowlands Beverages - Medlow Bath, NSW</b>\n\nMr. Evan Rowlands (1826-1894) was a pioneer in the aerated water trade in Australia. He began in Melbourne, eventually expanding to Sydney where he built a large factory at a cost of \u00a315,000, at the corner of Burns and Little Hay Streets, Darling Harbour.\n\nPure water was essential to the product, and a fine spring of water was discovered at Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains, and the site was leased from the government. The water was brought to Sydney by rail. <i>&mdash;More from the <a href=\"http://www.aussiebottledigger.com.au/college.HTML#rowland_lewis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bottle College.</a></i>\n\nMr Rowlands died in 1894 but his company continued until well after the Second World War, when it was sold to Schweppes.[<a href=\"http://www.auspostalhistory.com/articles/289.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a>]\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>&quot;Market Tree&quot;</b>\n\nI think it highly likely that this was originally meant to be captioned the <b>Marked Tree</b> which was, in theory, located on the highway between Medlow Bath and Katoomba.<blockquote><i>&quot;The tree was dead by late 1903 and as it was considered unsafe, the upper section was sawn off. That lay beside the highway until 1904 when it was removed by Mark Foy to his hotel at Medlow Bath. There it was erected as an 'historic relic' on a pedestal in the grounds of the Hydro Majestic ...&quot; </i></blockquote> I can't make out if the remains of the tree are at the right of this photograph. There looks like there could be a display of framed photographs &ndash; possibly different views of the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blue_mountains_library_-_local_studies/2585471137/\">tree</a>.(?)\n\nThis &quot;drink stall&quot; (and the staff) may be part of the Hydro Majestic Hotel -- more research is necessary.

It has lots of details about the Coo-ee March -- even an exact date (5 November 1915) for the big blowout at the Explorers Tree! ;)\n\nNow I just need to ponder the meaning of \u201cwash-up&quot; from the article -- as in \u201cThe biggest wash-up I ever heard of!\u201d  \n<blockquote>A local reporter wrote: \u201cHow well Springwood entertained is best told in the words of a lady who helped, \u2018It was the biggest wash-up that I ever heard of,\u2019 she said, and that is saying something coming from the sex that reckons life is one wash-up after another.\u201d</blockquote>\n\n(Current) usage of wash-up seems to mean a person  who is a &quot;loser&quot; or a failure. It's sometimes applied to sports players, as in &quot;he can't hit ... he's such a wash-up.&quot;\n\nBut in the context of the evening open-air concert and recruiting meeting at Springwood, I can't imagine it being used derisively.  So I would think wash-up would mean &quot;folks got cleaned up for the big event.&quot;  -- Course the rest of the quote doesn't help much: <i>&quot;and that is saying something coming from the sex that reckons life is one wash-up after another.&quot;</i> seems like that could go either way ;)\n\nAnd yes, you have solved the mystery object!! -- although until today I had never seen a horn that large for the Edison Phonograph. Amazing! (oh, the things one learns from the comments on Flickr! ;)  Thanks for including the photos for the larger horns!\n&nbsp;", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29361615-6003819555-72157635855962245", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/6003819555/#comment72157635865997844", "realname": "", "path_alias": "blue_mountains_library_-_local_studies", "author": "26602074@N06", "iconserver": "8263", "datecreate": "1380079689", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixelwrangler] Thanks Pixel Wrangler for your king comments on my blog article.\n\nNow a quote from the Macquarie Dictionary of Australia English which shows 50 shades of meaning to the word 'wash' including : &quot;Wash up - to wash dishes, saucepans etc. after a meal.&quot; \n\nIt is a slightly old fashioned expression though not actually archaic, and we would now say 'I'll do the washing up' as we put on the rubber gloves and squeeze the detergent bottle... \n\nAs opposed to 'washed up' and 'washed out' - both defined as failed, finished, completely exhausted.
