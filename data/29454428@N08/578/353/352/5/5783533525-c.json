I had the good fortune to visit Sydney and environs a few years ago for 5 weeks, and was enchanted with your country. I left with a fascination for the history of Australia, and a respect for the hardships that people endured. Thanks for posting these photographs, not only to delight me, but to preserve the rich history of NSW.", "authorname": "La Belle Province", "id": "29361615-5783533525-72157626730985821", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/5783533525/#comment72157626731101051", "realname": "State Library of New South Wales", "path_alias": "statelibraryofnsw", "author": "29454428@N08", "iconserver": "8544", "datecreate": "1306888182", "_content": "Thank you La Belle!
