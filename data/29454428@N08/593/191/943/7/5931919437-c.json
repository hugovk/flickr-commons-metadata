The dress may be a little out of date because an older photograph was used but the scandal had not broken until 1879 and the point of the photomontage was to capitalise on the news. (The woman's hairstyle would be ca. 1872-1876, possibly later than the dress which was kept for much longer then). Hence the 1879 date!", "authorname": "State Library of New South Wales collection", "id": "29361615-5931919437-72157637579189404", "iconfarm": 9}], "photo_id": "5931919437"}, "flarchive:created": 1389606327}
