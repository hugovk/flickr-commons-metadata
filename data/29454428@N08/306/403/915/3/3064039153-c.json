He was a skilful all-rounder, being a right arm bowler and right-handed batsman.\n\n&quot;Also known by his traditional name Unaarrimin (he was given the name 'Mullagh' to identify him with his place of birth), he played 47 matches on the 1868 England tour, scoring 1698 runs at an average of around 20 on pitches that were often treacherous. Spectators considered the equal of any English batter. He also bowled 1877 overs, 831 of which were maidens, and took 245 wickets at 10 apiece. If this weren't enough, he would occasionally don wicket-keeping gloves, achieving four stumpings.&quot;\n\nThere's also the <a href=\"http://www.johnnymullaghcricketcentre.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny Mullagh Cricket Centre</a> &ndash; a museum in country Victoria celebrating the cricket career of this aboriginal sporting hero.", "authorname": "Pixel Wrangler", "id": "29361615-3064039153-72157613999001811", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3064039153/#comment72157621766185134", "realname": "Paloma Toscano", "path_alias": "palomatoscanopeople", "author": "40609214@N07", "iconserver": "3447", "datecreate": "1248207545", "_content": "so old!
