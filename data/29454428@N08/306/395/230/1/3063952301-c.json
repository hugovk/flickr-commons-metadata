If you click on the purl and go to the larger version of this pic at the SLNSW web-site, you can see that the clock on the members' stand appears to indicate ca. 4.20.\n \nPer the match report which appeared in the SMH the following Monday, the Australian first innings commenced at 4.19 on the Saturday afternoon...so if the T&amp;CJ have the day right and if I've read the clock correctly, this pic might have been taken at about the time the Australian openers (Clem Hill and Victor Trumper) went in to bat. Per the SMH report the crowd grew to a then record of 36,000 during the afternoon - <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14429077\" rel=\"nofollow\">nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14429077</a>\n\nIf you click on the purl (which takes you to the SLNSW web-site) and then view the album, you can see that it contains all four of the pics which appeared in the T&amp;CJ...along with two other closer views of spectators in the stands - <a href=\"http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/album/albumView.aspx?acmsID=153370&amp;itemID=845981\" rel=\"nofollow\">acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/album/albumView.aspx?acmsID=153370&amp;amp...</a> ; If you zoom in on the 4th of the T&amp;CJ pics (which includes a view of the scoreboard) you can see the English total at 416/8...per the SMH report, England were 351/6 at lunch on the second day, so presumably these six SLNSW album pics were taken during the course of the Saturday afternoon. One of the closer view pics shows a brass band in action!\n\nThis was the first match of the 1901-1902 England v Australia test series...and just to get the convicts hopping, England won convincingly in 3 days by an innings and 24 runs! Yet despite the ordinary start, Australia in fact won the 1901-1902 series 4-1. During the second and third tests of the series, South Australian batsman Clem Hill made three consecutive scores of 99, 98 and 97.\n\nIf you're a cricket tragic ('beyond hope' category), the SLNSW has an extensive collection of cricket pics on their web-site...But I'm only interested in cricket as a cultural and social phenomenon so I'm not going there (!)\n\nAlso see this pic - <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2609378489/\">www.flickr.com/photos/powerhouse_museum/2609378489/</a>\n\nHere's the Sydney Mail's coverage - <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ygFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-5QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7448,8219863\" rel=\"nofollow\">news.google.com/newspapers?id=ygFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-5QDA...</a>", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-3063952301-72157630599651386", "iconfarm": 6}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/3063952301/#comment72157630694844546", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "51979177@N02", "iconserver": "5282", "datecreate": "1342965068", "_content": "Just to rewind a bit, here's the Sydney Mail's coverage of the English team's arrival in Sydney in November 1901, along with pics taken during the subsequent match against NSW.
