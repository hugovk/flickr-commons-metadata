Both grew up and played their early cricket in country NSW. Australian test cricketer and journalist Jack Fingleton maintained that McCabe played the three greatest test innings he had seen: 187 (n.o.) v England at Sydney in 1932; 189 (n.o.) v South Africa at Johannesburg in 1936; 232 v England at Nottingham in 1938. Bradman often stated that McCabe's innings at Nottingham was the best he had seen.\n\nThis pic is interesting in that it was taken at a point when Bradman's reputation as the greatest batsman to have played the game was not yet set in concrete...at the time debates raged among Australian cricket tragics as to whether Bradman was in the same league as Victor Trumper, who had mesmerised an earlier generation of cricket fans with his aggressive and often unorthodox strokeplay...and for many, Bradman's less than convincing performances during the bodyline series of 1932-1933 only served to reinforce their opinion that Trumper was the better batsman of the two. Of course, on the other side of the globe, English cricket tragics had similar debates re the respective merits of W.G. Grace, Ranji and Hobbs.", "authorname": "quasymody", "id": "29361615-3064017109-72157632348473265", "iconfarm": 6}], "photo_id": "3064017109"}, "flarchive:created": 1389898252}
