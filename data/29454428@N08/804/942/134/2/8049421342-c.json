Mounted on a Ford V-8 chassis, the caravan is the last word in comfort and utility.  Truly it was a home on wheels and bore out the contention of its owner that there was no need for them ever to worry about the hotels.  The design which was Mr. Birtles's own, was not evolved over-night nor was its execution a matter of merely days.  Such conveniences as mosquito proof windows, a floor that could be\ntaken out revealing further mosquito proofing, an electric radiator with a small motor to supply current for it and a seven valve wireless set with which they could have music wherever they went were added to collapsible tables and what was even mere attractive a latex rubber mattressed bed wide and long enough for two.  Height has been sacrificed to some\nextent to prevent the roof striking trees and branches in the rough going  but the ceiling was insulated to make  for pleasant conditions in all weathers.  Hunting gear of all kinds, including\na specially prepared line for crocodiles, was included in the equipment, while in lockers specially contrived to take up the minimum space is carried enough food to last three months. Tanks to hold 80 gallons of water are also part of the equipment. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n'Cairns Post' 7/8/1935. p.6", "authorname": "beachcomberaustralia", "id": "29361615-8049421342-72157631804055842", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8049421342/#comment72157632022313111", "realname": "", "path_alias": "mambo1935", "author": "79597829@N00", "iconserver": "48", "datecreate": "1353083068", "_content": "grace!", "authorname": "mambo1935", "id": "29361615-8049421342-72157632022313111", "iconfarm": 1}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8049421342/#comment72157634729960795", "realname": "Mich", "path_alias": "mich2009", "author": "35179849@N08", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1374426868", "_content": "better than the car he had before that one", "authorname": "mich_sydney_2007", "id": "29361615-8049421342-72157634729960795", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "8049421342"}, "flarchive:created": 1389892774}
