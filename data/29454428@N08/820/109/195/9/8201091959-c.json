However, they're not using 100% marble, quartz or alabaster (which ever it is) The clean lines and minimalist approach is all the rage today and has been for many years. In fact, some give credit to the 1960s for this design, this is where they fail. The minimalist design was first seen in France during the early 1920s. The 1960s gleaned those early French designers of the 20s for their most modern 60s design. \n\nJust goes to show, there really are no new ideas, just new adaptations of old designs.", "authorname": "worldsfair39", "id": "29361615-8201091959-72157632056546573", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryofnsw/8201091959/#comment72157632475623828", "realname": "", "path_alias": "spelio", "author": "61804295@N00", "iconserver": "2880", "datecreate": "1357685095", "_content": "I grew up in Turramurra, and know the railway station well!
