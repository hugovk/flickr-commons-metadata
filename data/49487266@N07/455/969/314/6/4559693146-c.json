NAA took one of the 'B's off the line and fitted it with a Harvard canopy, wing and tail feathers. Only one of these interim aircraft was constructed but the design evolved, with the addition of a slightly different wing and a metal clad fuselage in place of the original fabric covered tubing, into the BT-14. The Wright Whirlwind engine was replaced with a more powerful P&amp;W R-985 Wasp Junior. Like its predecessor, the BT-9, this aircraft was never known as the Yale.\n\nDoug MacPhail", "authorname": "macharvard", "id": "49465936-4559693146-72157625166253488", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4559693146"}, "flarchive:created": 1389773096}
