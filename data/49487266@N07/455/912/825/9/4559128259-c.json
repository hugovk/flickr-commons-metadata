LCD Baldwin was the XO. \nDuring qualification flights off the California coast prior to our deployment to WestPac \nseveral of the pilots had problems getting the F-8U Crusader on the deck of the Hancock.\nMajor John Glenn, USMC fighter pilot, came aboard the Hancock for 10 days and help \nget the situation stabilized. Major Glenn was the typical hot-fighter jock. \nNo one knew he would be an Astronaut, but you knew he was going places! \nI was on the o7 level of the Hancock when Lt. Ramsey was killed during flight ops. \nThe right wheel assembly gave way during his landing and the plane skidded off the deck. \nHe got back to approximately 600 feet and ejected but the chute didn't completely deploy. \nA sad day for the entire ship. \n12/03/2008 @ 17:41 [ref: 23181]\n\nDedicated website with pictures of VF-154s early period with the F8U-1 \nand interesting historical comment:\n<a href=\"http://www.miottelcollection.com/index/Callsign+%22Crash%22+Page+1\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.miottelcollection.com/index/Callsign+%22Crash%22+Page+1</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/F8Firstnational.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/F8Firstnational.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/f8cat.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/f8cat.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/cat1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/cat1.jpg</a>\n(courtesy of John \u2018Crash\u2019 Miottel)\n\nAnother image of the \u2018flickr\u2019 pic above may also be viewed here:\n<a href=\"http://www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/f8cat2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.miottelcollection.com/uploads/f8cat2.jpg</a>", "authorname": "AceFlyboy1", "id": "49465936-4559128259-72157628915174301", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4559128259"}, "flarchive:created": 1389768802}
