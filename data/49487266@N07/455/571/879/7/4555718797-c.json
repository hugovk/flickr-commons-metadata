Under constant pressure from the North Vietnamese in their attempt to gain military information and propaganda material, Captain Cameron experienced severe torture with ropes and by beatings and was kept in solitary confinement. As they persisted in their hostile treatment of him, he continued to resist by feigning sickness and refusing to eat anything but a bare minimum of food. Through those means he was successful in his attempt to keep himself unacceptable in appearance to the North Vietnamese, thus discouraging them from forcing him to meet visiting antiwar delegations for propaganda purposes. He gallantly evaded exploitation by the North Vietnamese throughout his lengthy confinement. By his exceptional courage, determination, and resourcefulness in a most difficult line of resistance, he reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service and the United States Armed Forces.\n\nMy respect to the memory of the pilot and to his family and friends.\n\n1965 picture of A-4C 147816 - only available commercially:\n<a href=\"http://www.cloud9photography.us/Contributing-Cloud-9/JANSSON-Clay-USA/4523236_4CsNDB/407450257_9n2CD7d\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cloud9photography.us/Contributing-Cloud-9/JANSSON-Cla...</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.cloud9photography.us/keyword/va95%20a4%20skyhawk/407450257_9n2CD7d#!i=407450257&amp;k=9n2CD7d\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cloud9photography.us/keyword/va95%20a4%20skyhawk/4074...</a>\nA-4USN 00017 Douglas A-4C Skyhawk USN 147816 VA-95 NAS Leemore by Clay Jansson.\n\n \nColor profile of A-4C 147816 with VA-95 in 1965:\n<a href=\"http://wp.scn.ru/en/ww3/a/783/3/10\" rel=\"nofollow\">wp.scn.ru/en/ww3/a/783/3/10</a>\nA-4C 147816 Unit: VA-95, US Navy\nSerial: 501/NG (BuNo.147816)\n\nAirframe information for A4D-2N/A-4C 147816 courtesy the \u2018A-4 Skyhawk Association\u2019", "authorname": "AceFlyboy1", "id": "49465936-4555718797-72157638389496423", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4555718797"}, "flarchive:created": 1389789201}
