Flying out \nof San Diego, the squadron\u2019s aircraft were painted in one of the better recognized schemes \nin an era of already colorful Naval aircraft. As the only Navy squadron, \nVFAW-3 twice won NORAD\u2019s trophy for best performing unit, placing above USAF squadrons \nin the process. During this time, VFAW-3 was deployed to Key West for the Cuban Missile crisis. \nThat and a deployment to Taiwan in 1958 were the nearest the Ford would get to combat action.\u201d\n\n((Navy slang for the F4D was 'Ford'))\n\nF4D-1 139164 was chosen as a subject by Japanese model company \u201cTamiya\u201d with their \n1/48 scale F4D-1 Skyray kit number 61055:\n<a href=\"http://www.cybermodeler.com/hobby/kits/tam/kit_tam_61055.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cybermodeler.com/hobby/kits/tam/kit_tam_61055.shtml</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.cybermodeler.com/hobby/kits/tam/images/tam_f4d_decals1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.cybermodeler.com/hobby/kits/tam/images/tam_f4d_decals...</a>\nF4D-1 139164 was also chosen as a subject by Japanese model company \u201cTamiya\u201d with \ntheir 1/72 scale F4D-1 Skyray kit number 60741:\n<a href=\"http://www.hobbywarehouse.com/60741-1-72-F4D-1-Skyray\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.hobbywarehouse.com/60741-1-72-F4D-1-Skyray</a>\n \nThere is as yet no other known internet reference to F4D-1 139164.", "authorname": "AceFlyboy1", "id": "49465936-4559849392-72157629066710124", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4559849392"}, "flarchive:created": 1389761773}
