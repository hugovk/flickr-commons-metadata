These were then changed for the uprated F-8H version. \nThe squadron made seven deployments to southeast Asia. \n\nF-8P 147056 was one of 35 F-8H sold to the Republic of the Philippines and still survives.\n\nIn late 1977, the Philippine government purchased 35 ex US Navy F-8Hs stored \nat MASDC in Arizona. Twenty-five were refurbished by Vought and \nremaining 10 used for spares. \nOperational until January 1988, most of the remainder were placed in open storage at \nBasa Air Base. Stored airframes were damaged beyond use on 15 June 1991 \nby Mount Pinatubo eruption and eventually sold as scrap.\n\nF-8P Crusader 147056 (c/n 99) Philippine Air Force serial number 47056/313 \nis on display (as 147056) outdoors at Philippine Air Force Museum, Villamor Air Base, \nNinoy Aquino International Airport.
