This aircraft is a real mystery. It is not a North American Aviation - built example because there are no venturis on the fuselage side, below the front canopy section.  The French order taken over by the RAF all had large radio masts mounted on the nose decking. The initial order built by Noorduyn in Canada also had the venturis mentioned earlier, but the second order did not. So, this appears to be from the second Noorduyn batch - except for what appears to be a radio mast protruding from the rear canopy. This fitting did not appear in Canada until 1947 - and the roundels seen here are wrong for that period. \n\nDoug MacPhail", "authorname": "macharvard", "id": "49465936-4555944967-72157625047084073", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4555944967"}, "flarchive:created": 1389786775}
