This aircraft, a Harvard Mk II built for the RCAF by NAA, has been restored and refurbished for display at Canada's National Aviation Museum. The missing venturis were there when the aircraft was built, but have been removed at some point. The radio mast was fitted when the aircraft was refurbished uring a major program in 1947. The missing landing gear doors were removed in service as a nuisance during extreme weather. In fact, Canadian built Harvard Mk 4s were delivered without the offending doors.\n\nDoug MacPhail", "authorname": "macharvard", "id": "49465936-4556573868-72157625047107539", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4556573868"}, "flarchive:created": 1389786776}
