Flying out \nof San Diego, the squadron\u2019s aircraft were painted in one of the better recognized schemes \nin an era of already colorful Naval aircraft. As the only Navy squadron, \nVFAW-3 twice won NORAD\u2019s trophy for best performing unit, placing above USAF squadrons \nin the process. During this time, VFAW-3 was deployed to Key West for the Cuban Missile crisis. \nThat and a deployment to Taiwan in 1958 were the nearest the Ford would get to combat action.\u201d\n\n((Navy slang for the F4D was 'Ford'))\n\nF4D-1 134802 was chosen for a subject by commercial model decal company \u201cEagle Strike\u201d \n1/72 scale set number 72-043\n<a href=\"http://members.home.nl/thunderchief/modeling/pages/enf4d101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">members.home.nl/thunderchief/modeling/pages/enf4d101.htm</a>\n\nF4D-1 134802 was also chosen for a subject by commercial model decal company\n\u201cCutting Edge Decals\u201d in a 1/48 scale set number CED48091        \n\u201c1/48 F4D-1, 134802, PA32 of VFAW-3, Same as kit scheme, except \nSEPARATE YELLOW STARS!
