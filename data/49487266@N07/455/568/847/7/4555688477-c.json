Two AD-3Ws (BuNos 122906 and 122907) and \ntwo AD-3Ns (BuNos 122901 and 122911) were modified as AD-3E (search) and \nAD-3S (attack) aircraft in an experimental program to demonstrate the feasibility of \nhunter/killer antisubmarine teams. \nUnder this strategy, the AD-3E and AD-3S would operate in pairs, with the AD-3E \nhunting for submarines, and the AD-3S destroying the submarine once it was found. \nPicture dated 1950.
