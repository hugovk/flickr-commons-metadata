This machine got about the double  engine power as a 415 hp (nominal power) / 428 hp (maximum power) Curtiss K-12 was fitted. The Curtiss D-12 was a 12-cylinder Vee type water cooled engine, hence the big radiators at the side of the fuselage, which added some drag to the machine. Given the power of the engine it was decided to use a four-bladed propeller. The Balilla finished the race and came in as fourth. A few days before this Balilla had got in first with the American Legion Derby.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-4822154065-72157635442347175", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4822154065"}, "flarchive:created": 1389584983}
