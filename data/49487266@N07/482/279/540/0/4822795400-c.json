FK.27 a sports biplane built after WW1. It shows the very early civil registration K-143 which was later changed to G-EAFA. Only one example was built (c/n. 33), but as customers for this expensive and beautifully made machine were lacking, the machine was abondoned and scrapped in 1920.\nThis civilian machine was surely based on the military FK.23 Bantam, but the pilot position was changed backwards behind the wings, slightly more comfortable for a civilian pilot. This type had no nickname, no idea what the basis is of 'Skinned Bat' but there is no evidence for that name.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-4822795400-72157634283199046", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4822795400/#comment72157634302143759", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1372093435", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/varese2002] Thanks!", "authorname": "San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives", "id": "49465936-4822795400-72157634302143759", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "4822795400"}, "flarchive:created": 1389583872}
