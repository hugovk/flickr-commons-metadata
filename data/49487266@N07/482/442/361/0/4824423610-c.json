Marcel Dassault started life as <b>Marcel Bloch</b> , but given the atrocities of WW2 in France he changed his name after that war to <b>Marcel Dassault</b>. \n\nThis machine was designed by Marcel Bloch, assisted by Henry Potez and Louis Coroller, for S.E.A. -- the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9tudes A\u00e9ronautiques. It was the first Bloch-designed aircraft to reach production. Powered by a Lorraine 12 cylinder inline engine of 350 hp, it had a top speed of 136mph and a service ceiling of 24,272 ft. First flew in the spring of 1918, resulting in an order for 1,000 aircraft from the French Ministry of War and Industry. It was planned to have 400 in service by April 1 1919 in two variations; the SEA IV A2 in observation squadrons and the SEA IV C2 for combat. The first production aircraft left the factory on -- ironically -- November 11, 1918. \n\nThe order was therefore cancelled, but the 115 aircraft already in production were delivered and served post-war.\n\nIn most (all) reference books the machine is identified as the <b>Potez SEA.IV</b>.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-4824423610-72157625032348568", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4824423610"}, "flarchive:created": 1389581589}
