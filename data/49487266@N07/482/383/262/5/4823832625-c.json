The unit is Jasta 18, a German fighter squadron. The aircraft at left is a Spad XIII which was captured. The D.H.4 (British designation for British/Airco-built version and not US-built DH-4) is most likely from No. 55 Sqdn. RAF (IF or Independent Force). It is painted in the livery of Jasta 18, front half of the aircraft = vermillion red/rear third of aircraft = white. The radiator shell and underside of nose are also painted white. Struts and wing surfaces most likely overpainted in vermillion. Aircraft was used as a hack by Jasta 18 aka Staffel &quot;Raben&quot; after their commander, Ltn.
