After it's career at Swiftaire, This aircraft (N421SA) and it's sisters N422SA and N423SA were sold to AirNorth a regional air carrier based in Burlington, VT in 1982 where I became acquainted with her. All three airplanes retained the overall SwiftAire livery until 1984 when AirNorth was purchased by Brockway Glass which renamed the airline Brockway Air. The livery was changed again in 1986 to reflect the Brockway Air alliance with Piedmont Airlines. This particular airplane last saw service in Bolivia with Lloyd Aero Boliviano in 1987 and was &quot;written off&quot; on December 22, 1994. She was a good old bird and along with her sister aircraft will be fondly remembered.", "authorname": "mjfinegan", "id": "49465936-4824683896-72157625737104813", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4824683896/#comment72157625868825670", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1295551938", "_content": "Thanks for the info!", "authorname": "San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives", "id": "49465936-4824683896-72157625868825670", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "4824683896"}, "flarchive:created": 1389578715}
