This is a D.H.4, a license-built example from the British firm, Westland fitted with a Siddeley-Puma(?) engine. The parent firm, Airco in Britain, whose designer was Geoffrey de Havilland, was the originator of the type, Airco D.H.4. The official designation for this aircraft is DeHavilland D.H.4 (note the periods after the D and H.) There is an important distinction here. The aircraft shown above (of No. 27 Sqdn. RFC/RAF) was built in Britain by Westland, one of several firms contracted to build the type under license with numerous engine types (this one has the Siddeley Puma, I believe... the two updraft carburetor intakes are under the nose). The Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII was by far the best engine for the type. Supply of that engine type, however, could not keep up with demand and alternate powerplants had to be found. Engines like the BHP, RAF3 (Royal Aircraft Factory), Siddelely Puma, Sunbeam Arab, and Fiat powered these various license-built versions.\n\nThe US was desperately looking for aircraft for their Air Service and decided on the D.H.4. However, the British couldn't supply them with it, but, after license negotiations were made, an example was sent to the U.S. and studied. The type, adapted for U.S. mass production would become known as the DH-4 (as you have it w/ a dash and no periods) built by Dayton-Wright Corporation, and Fisher Body and powered by the 400 h.p. Liberty vee-12 engine. Only the American-built version is properly known as the DH-4. This photo doesn't not show that type... thus D.H.4 is the proper nomenclature that should apply here. Hairsplitting you say? Not a bit... the history explaines why.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-4824445310-72157629735912003", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4824445310"}, "flarchive:created": 1389580981}
