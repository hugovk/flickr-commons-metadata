The F.50, as seen on the previous pages, was a larger, twin-engine design &quot;heavy&quot; bomber with twin &quot;tractor&quot; engines of over 200 h.p. The F.40, seen here, had a 160 h.p. engine, either a Renault or Peugeot engine. This one appears to wear the two color chevron of the CRP which was involved in the Defense of Paris and is fitted with both a machine gun, as well as Le Prieur rockets to attack German Zeppelins or other intruders.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-4989965153-72157629735042857", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4989965153"}, "flarchive:created": 1389553459}
