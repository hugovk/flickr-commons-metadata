The MX-324 was the rocket-powered version prototype (powered by Aerojet and GALCIT's XCALR-2000 red fuming nitric acid and monoethylaniline liquid fuel) and featured a rear tail fin in the middle back of the rocket plane, which had its one and only flight test on July 5, 1944 at Harper Dry Lake in Hinkley, CA (close 20 miles north of Barstow).  The MX-334 was tested strictly as a glider to study its aerodynamic properties and handling.", "authorname": "TANC_MA_Freeman", "id": "49465936-4590560662-72157627324166729", "iconfarm": 0}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4590560662/#comment72157627448578764", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "52734396@N05", "iconserver": "0", "datecreate": "1313516041", "_content": "The other, preceding picture in your album is the correctly identified MX-324 rocket plane, which I took liberty of making note of in the comment window.  Oh, I should have mentioned that the XCALR-2000 was a rocket motor (to power the MX-324) that was produced through joint development between Aerojet, CalTech,  the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) and then the recently founded Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).  Very nice high-res pictures, by the way!
