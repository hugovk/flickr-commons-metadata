The man behind the firm were J.W. Catron and Edward M. Fisk. \n\nThis biplane dates from 1919 and was a sport model fitted with an OX-5 engine of 90 hp, where the radiator was characteristically positioned just in front of the pilot. Two sets of wings were provided, one set for the single seat sport type and another for a two-seat utility type. Span of the sporting type was 18 feet, while the two-seater had a span of 29 feet. Maximum speed of the sport model is 130 miles / hour (not bad for the times !).\n\nOnly one machine was built, but commercially a failure with all the war surplus machines available at break down prices  Catron &amp; Fisk persevered on for a few years, building several types, quite a lot of them being triplanes.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-4590336828-72157624894924449", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4590336828"}, "flarchive:created": 1389610164}
