Pan Am sold it to Mid-Continent Airlines on 30 March 1950. Over the years it had was flown by various operators including Braniff Airways, Air Jordan as JY-ACA and Linee Aeree Italiane as I-LAKE. Unfortunately, it appears this Convair 240, carrying the Mexican registration XC-DOK, crashed into La Vega Hill near Poza Rica, Mexico on 25 January 1970. The aircraft carried journalists reporting on the Mexican presidential campaign, and 19 of 20 aboard were killed.
