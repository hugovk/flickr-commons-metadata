His plane was a Cessna Model AW with a Warner-Scarab engine, one of only 48 built, that he called &quot;The Kangaroo&quot;. He set the east-to-west, then the west-to-east, and the combined round trip record. He was the youngest certificated pilot in the United States, and the youngest certified airplane mechanic. He was a pilot in the Spanish Civil War in the Yankee Squadron. He died in an airplane crash in 1940 while training another pilot, when a US Navy bomber clipped his plane's tail at Floyd Bennett Field.", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "49465936-5022016284-72157631749771475", "iconfarm": 3}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/5022016284/#comment72157631752848384", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1350059106", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/richard_arthur_norton] Thank you for your informative comments!", "authorname": "San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives", "id": "49465936-5022016284-72157631752848384", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "5022016284"}, "flarchive:created": 1387822595}
