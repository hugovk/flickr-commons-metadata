The event was the celebration of the 50th anniversary of his first solo in a Piper Cub. In 1976, Bert was Chief Instructor at Gibbs Flite Center. That year, he hired me as a flight instructor when I retired from the Navy. Bert could be cranky at times, but he was a great old guy and a good friend.", "authorname": "jrnjaa", "id": "49465936-5021484395-72157625368455302", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5021484395"}, "flarchive:created": 1387816158}
