This is Harriet Quimby with William Willard, organizer of the Third Annual Boston Aviation Meet of 1912. With Willard, as passenger, Quimby circled the Boston Lighthouse as part of the airshow. On the return flight back the aircraft was at 1000 ft. making its landing descent. Inexplicably, Willard was thrown suddenly from the plane. The aircraft pitched further and Quimby also was ejected. Both died on impact in the shallow waters. The tragedy took place on July 1, 1912.", "authorname": "97point6", "id": "49465936-5021953136-72157628907077421", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5021953136"}, "flarchive:created": 1387825039}
