The pilots were seated side-by-side in the open air and eight passengers could be carried. The engine configuration of four engines was a speciality of the Bl\u00e9riot firm, who had this form patented during WW1. The essence was that by mounting the four engines close to the fuselage, stability would improve and the machine could remain in the air with just two engines running.\nEngines fitted were four Hispano-Suiza 8Ac eight-cylinder vee water-cooled engines of 180 hp each.\nThe machine was first flown on May 9, 1923 but was not very successful, only one other sample was built.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-4990570884-72157626242596640", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4990570884/#comment72157626120298207", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1299876034", "_content": "Thank you for that info!", "authorname": "San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives", "id": "49465936-4990570884-72157626120298207", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "4990570884"}, "flarchive:created": 1389553331}
