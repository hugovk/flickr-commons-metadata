I believe there are plans to eventually operate it as a secondary airport to relieve some of the congestion at the aging Honolulu International.  The navy air based was shut down in the 1990s.  Some areas remain restricted, but the housing has been opened up to low income families, some of the facilities are being used for local business, and the beaches are public.  The Coast Guard continues to operate out of their original facilities on the airfield.", "authorname": "JBernadez", "id": "49465936-4841273043-72157628153325359", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "4841273043"}, "flarchive:created": 1389559843}
