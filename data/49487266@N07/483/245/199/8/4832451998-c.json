In general it looks to me if there are P-38s, barrage balloons and this hanger in the picture it is at Mines Field. Why they are labeled at Hammer Field, Fresno, CA I don\u2019t know.\nBest regards,\nTom", "authorname": "tommichel50", "id": "49465936-4832451998-72157630029880849", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4832451998"}, "flarchive:created": 1389573028}
