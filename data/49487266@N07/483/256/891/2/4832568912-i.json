(Joseph Malta F.) Haase collection, courtesy of the San Diego Aero Space Museum.  J.M.F. \u201cBunny\u201d Haase was a Navy Chief photographer who documented all the aviation activities from the early 1920 through the early 1930s at North Island that at the time encompassed the Army\u2019s Rockwell Field and NAS San Diego.  His large collection also covers civilian and Army aircraft as well.  His air-to-air photographs are featured in many aviation reference books but usually under the credit line of US Navy.  Chief Haase also participated in the second Alaskan Aerial Survey in 1929 and was responsible for the first US motion picture of the sun\u2019s eclipse done in 1930 that was done from an aircraft."}, "isfavorite": 0, "views": "420", "farm": 5, "visibility": {"isfriend": 0, "isfamily": 0, "ispublic": 1}, "rotation": 0, "dates": {"taken": "2004-12-02 11:17:52", "lastupdate": "1359398549", "takengranularity": "0", "posted": "1280185658"}, "originalsecret": "af068a501c", "license": "7", "notes": {"note": []}, "server": "4126", "safety_level": "0", "urls": {"url": [{"type": "photopage", "_content": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4832568912/"}]}, "editability": {"canaddmeta": 0, "cancomment": 0}}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389570550}
