The photo, at the bottom of page 423, has a caption which states:\n<i>&quot;A group of enthusiasts taken at San Diego, Cal. From left to right, George Hallett, Raymund V. Morris, Katherine Stinson, Lieut. R.A.B. Sutton, Lieut. Jose Morrow, Lieut. Bown, Lieut. Walter R. Taliaferro.&quot;</i>\n<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=znbmAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=police&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=hallett&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">books.google.com/books?id=znbmAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=front...</a>\n\nThere are some slight misidentifications in the <i>Aerial Age</i> caption of the photo - &quot;Raymund V. Morris&quot; is Raymond V. Morris,  &quot;Lieut. R.A.B. Sutton&quot; is Redondo B. Sutton (who would come to later infamy in a 1920's swindling scheme),  &quot;Lieut. Jose Morrow&quot; is John C. Morrow, Jr.,  and &quot;Lieut. Bown&quot; is Thomas S. Bowen.  Given the identity of those in the photo, this almost certainly was taken at the Curtiss Aviation School at North Island sometime in the first half of 1915.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-4835528908-72157626563550042", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4835528908"}, "flarchive:created": 1389567629}
