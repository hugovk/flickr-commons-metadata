That happens to be in the book written by John Toland, circa 1963, &quot;The Flying Tigers&quot;.  I photographed it.  Supposedly it was used by Hump pilots and the Flying Tigers.  I was told of a crash site, maybe Flying Tigers aircraft, between Lijiang and Shangri-la, China, by a former PLA Ranger, named Ah-Hui, from Lijiang.\n\nIn 2007, I visited the gravesite of the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, near Kunming.  Sadly, all the graves were molested, headstones/grave markers strewn about, graves opened, with bones exposed.  I have photos.\n\nThere were Chinese Flying Tigers, but there are some supposed Flying Tigers aficionados who deny their existence.", "authorname": "CASSIDY PHOTOGRAPHY", "id": "49465936-4838346255-72157631846621095", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "4838346255"}, "flarchive:created": 1389563845}
