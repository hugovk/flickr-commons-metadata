No fin or stabilizer,  which were replaced by alarge, moveable stabilator and  a longitudinally-adjusteable 50# weight on a track to  shift the c/g.

(Joseph Malta F.) Haase collection, courtesy of the San Diego Aero Space Museum.  J.M.F. \u201cBunny\u201d Haase was a Navy Chief photographer who documented all the aviation activities from the early 1920 through the early 1930s at North Island that at the time encompassed the Army\u2019s Rockwell Field and NAS San Diego.  His large collection also covers civilian and Army aircraft as well.  His air-to-air photographs are featured in many aviation reference books but usually under the credit line of US Navy.
