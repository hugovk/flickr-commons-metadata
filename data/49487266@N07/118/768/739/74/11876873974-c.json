The USS Philip was featured in the 1965 Otto Preminger film In Harm's Way starring John Wayne. It makes its appearance as the destroyer that steams out of Pearl Harbor at the beginning of the 7 Dec 1941 attack, joins up with the Wayne character's cruiser in an ad hoc task group, depth charges a Japanese submarine that attacks the task group, and pulls alongside the Wayne character's cruiser to render aid after it has been torpedoed by the same Japanese submarine.\n \nPhilip decommissioned 30 September 1968 and was struck from the Navy List 1 October 1968. She was sold 15 December 1971, but sank in a storm on her way to be scrapped 2 February 1972.\n \nPhilip received nine battle stars for World War II service and five battle stars for Korean War service.\n \n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Philip_$DD-498$\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Philip_$DD-498$</a>", "authorname": "Konabish ~ Greg Bishop", "id": "49465936-11876873974-72157639634183016", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "11876873974"}, "flarchive:created": 1389548176}
