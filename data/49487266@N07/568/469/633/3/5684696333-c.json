However, such shortages never materialized and Ryan's PT-22 was firmly entrenched in the primary trainer role during the Second World War.  Accordingly, only five YPT-25's were ever manufactured (Air Force Serial Numbers 42-8703, 42-8704, 42-8705, 42-8706, and 42-8707).   Presumably, all five are captured in the photograph above.\n\nHere are a couple of articles in Flight Magazine (today's &quot;Flight International&quot;) describing the YPT-25:\n\n<b>Plastic Trainer</b>\n<i>New Ryan Built of Bonded Plywood</i>\nFlight\nNo. 1768 - Volume XLII\nPage 531\nNovember 12, 1942\n<a href=\"http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1942/1942 - 2373.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1942/1942%20-%202373...</a>\n\n<b>Aircraft Types and Their Characteristics</b>\n<b>Ryan PT-25</b>\nFlight\nNo. 1827 - Volume XLIV\nPage 722\nDecember 30, 1943\n<a href=\"http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1943/1943 - 3038.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1943/1943%20-%203038...</a>", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-5684696333-72157626691878022", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/5684696333/#comment72157626743893541", "realname": "Fred Roessler", "path_alias": null, "author": "31716342@N00", "iconserver": "188", "datecreate": "1307026054", "_content": "I see part of a wing and tail of a B-24 on the right side of this picture.", "authorname": "stumbleon", "id": "49465936-5684696333-72157626743893541", "iconfarm": 1}], "photo_id": "5684696333"}, "flarchive:created": 1387808015}
