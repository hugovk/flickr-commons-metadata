Undeterred, Mahoney pointed out that &quot;people are more ready to accept flying than you may think.&quot; And he offered to put up the money for an airline for a share of the profits.\n\nRyan agreed, and the Los Angeles\u00ad San Diego Air Line came into being on March 1, 1925. The fare was $14.50 one way, $22.50 round trip. It was claimed to be the first airline in the United States to operate all year on a regular schedule.\n\nOn April 19, 1925, Mahoney bought a half interest in Ryan's operations--the airline, aviation school and the charter and sightseeing business--for $7,500. The two became partners under the name Ryan Airlines.\n<a href=\"http://www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/mahoney.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/mahoney.asp</a>", "authorname": "archiecat2011", "id": "49465936-5684020999-72157629469499050", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5684020999"}, "flarchive:created": 1387812028}
