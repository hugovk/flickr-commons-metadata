This is actually a Convair 340 (CV-340), United Air Lines first CV-340 delivered and the second CV-340 off of the production line, N73102 (c/n 2).  \n\nInterestingly, this aircraft still flies today, converted (by Pacific Airmotive) into a turboprop powered Convair 580 (CV-580), wearing the registration N580HW as a avionics testbed for Honeywell Aviation Services.  Here's a photo of the airplane in its current guise:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/25695066@N00/5055400998/in/photostream]\n\nAs stated,  this aircraft was delivered to United Air Lines (UAL) as N73102, on September 2, 1952.  Frontier Airlines would then be the next operator of the aircraft (same registration) in August 1966.  After Frontier, the airplane would be purchased by Gem State Airlines and re-registered as N116GS in May 1979.  Gem State as then renamed Golden Gate Airlines in 1980.
