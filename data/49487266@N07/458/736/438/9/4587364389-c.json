Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II has a similar photo however it lacks the housing aft of the canopy. The photo on page 221 of that book also shows what appear to be a fourth pair of exhaust stacks. Still the machines are very similar. The only photo of a Curtiss AT-4 I found was online and shows a single seat biplane similar to the P-1.", "authorname": "thunder_walker2002", "id": "49465936-4587364389-72157632553626333", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4587364389"}, "flarchive:created": 1389682343}
