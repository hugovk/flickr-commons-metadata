The other picture in this album of the tailless  glider also identified as the MX-324 is actually Northrop's designated MX-334 non-powered glider, which was used for aerodynamic and handling flight test evaluations.  Both versions of the MX planes were predecessor prototypes for Northrop's XP-79 flying wing series (3) prototypes, including the Northrop XP-79B, which flew under jet power with a  pair of Westinghouse 19-XB axial flow jet engines on September 12, 1945 and crashed in an uncontrollable roll maneuver and killing test pilot Crosby.  The incident brought the USAAF to almost immediately cancel the XP-79 test program (under &quot;Project X&quot;).", "authorname": "TANC_MA_Freeman", "id": "49465936-4589940815-72157627448538526", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4589940815"}, "flarchive:created": 1389601497}
