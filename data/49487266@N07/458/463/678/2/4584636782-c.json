The French believed that multi-engined aicraft should have twin tails.  However, Douglas found the twin-tail offered no appreciable benefits over the single rudder design, and the DB-7/A-20 design remained a single rudder aircraft.  \n\nDepending on the timing of the photo, the roundels may be painted over because France had capitulated to Germany by the time this photo was taken.  Still, the tail flash on the rudders betrays its original French purchaser.  DB-7s ordered by the French, but not delivered to France before their surrender, were eventually delivered to Great Britain.", "authorname": "TVL1970", "id": "49465936-4584636782-72157625410679502", "iconfarm": 8}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/4584636782/#comment72157628800428445", "realname": "", "path_alias": null, "author": "47723191@N04", "iconserver": "7001", "datecreate": "1326150274", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/25695066@N00] \nSorry, those may have been repainted, but I doubt it.  That's RAF camo with RAF markings and an RAF serial number.  There's not a French drop of paint on the plane that I can see.  That's an RAF-sized roundel circle and an RAF fin flash.
