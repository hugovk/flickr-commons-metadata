This Dornier Wal was once built in Italy (CMASA) and after having been in use by the polar researcher Amundsen it was sold to Germany and  registered D-1422 and used by Wolfgang von Gronau and his crew in their long distance flight from Sylt (in Germany) to New York. Starting on August 18th, 1930 they arrived to New York on August 26th at 16.35H.\nSince there is no record of any return flight, what we are looking at is most certainly Art Carroll and the boys taking the aircraft apart and preparing her for a return by boat.\nStig", "authorname": "Avis1951", "id": "49465936-11735682784-72157639439540214", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "11735682784"}, "flarchive:created": 1389548839}
