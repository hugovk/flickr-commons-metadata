Manufactured in the Netherlands as Dutch Fokker c/n 4955.  It was shipped to the US on May 15, 1926, where it received the new c/n 602 and registration NC2195, and was used by Continental Motors as an engine test bed and executive transport.  Following a crash on July 7, 1927, it was rebuilt at the Atlantic factory using parts from Fokker C-2 NC55 (c/n 1), re-registered NC3908, and sold to Western Air Express on February 2, 1928.  It was finally wrecked in a non-fatal accident on September 20, 1929 at Saugus, CA.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kemon01/6475799407/]\nPhoto via Kemon01.", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-11735249495-72157639672104275", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "11735249495"}, "flarchive:created": 1389548922}
