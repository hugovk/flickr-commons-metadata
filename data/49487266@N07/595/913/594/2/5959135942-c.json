This type was very successful and flew in 1915, but was used thru the end of the war. It was used in active combat thru 1917, and then in the training role, and postwar in the civilian passenger role. It also was used in the Middle-East by the Germans with the Pascha units and with their Turkish allies. It outperformed the British and French pusher types easily in the Middle-Eastern theatres and not until the arrival of the S.E.5a and Bristol Fighters was it threatened in its role. It was able to handle the B.E.2c, d, e types and the Martinsyde G.100-102s and HF-22s that it faced rather handily.", "authorname": "Aviatik IMG", "id": "49465936-5959135942-72157629594354713", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "5959135942"}, "flarchive:created": 1387806768}
