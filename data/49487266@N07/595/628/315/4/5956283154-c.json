The L-class was positioned between the G-class [Grossflugzeug - with two engines] and the R-class [Riesenflugzeuge]. The design started life as the Siemens-Schuckert G.III (the G.I and G.II were projects only), but this was quickly changed to L.I. It is given that the machine was modeled on the successful Italian Caproni bombers. There is no evidence that this machine was designed by the Steffen brothers.", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-5956283154-72157637037364825", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5956283154"}, "flarchive:created": 1387807945}
