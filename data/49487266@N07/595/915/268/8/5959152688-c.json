The picture shows the <b>Antoinette IV</b> being pushed into the wing for the attempted flight over the Channel on July 19, 1909. Unfortunately the engine malfunctioned and the machine fell in the water when almost in sight of Dover. Only 5 miles to fly. As everybody knows Bl\u00e9riot flew the whole Channel and Latham after a second failed attempt never did. \n\nVery muddy field, which made it already miraculous that the machine could come loose from the clay. \n\nRemark the steering wheels at both sides of the Antoinette fuselage which was the favored way of steering the Antoinettes. Big ailerons are hinging on the monoplane wings. A beauty of a picture.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/publicresourceorg/494104905/in/set-72157600215541065]\n\nFrom the Library of Congress collection, where the print of the whole original picture can be seen (it is somewhat bigger than this print)", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-5959152688-72157635136398561", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5959152688"}, "flarchive:created": 1387806710}
