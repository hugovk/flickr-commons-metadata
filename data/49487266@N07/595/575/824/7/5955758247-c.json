While it was frustrating that most of the images are tiny, it is refreshing to see that you are now posting higher resolution images.  And the coverage of the Shorts products, my favorite manufacturer, and a historically important one, is a significant addition.  However I can't help but notice that this latest set of uploads is scanned incorrectly, with all of the images appearing very dark.  The excitement of finally seeing the Short 'boats uploaded to your collection, and at higher resolution, is indeed made bittersweet  by this technical error.  Any chance of re-scanning the Shorts images at the correct brightness?\nKeep up the good work, love your site!!\nThanks.", "authorname": "Batman_60", "id": "49465936-5955758247-72157627242977654", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "5955758247"}, "flarchive:created": 1387807141}
