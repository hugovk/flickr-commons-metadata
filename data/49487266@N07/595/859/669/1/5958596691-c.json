Sure is not a machine with a similarity to the Taube, the crucial wing construction is a 'normal' monoplane construction here. In the end this is not even a German machine but a <b>Hanriot</b> monoplane. As these machines evaluated in time, for instance the steering system evaluated from the Antoinette-system steering wheels at the fuselage side, to handles at the side of the fuselage to finally this method of steering wheel. This is most likely the last Hanriot model (year 1912) a two-seater version, with extra oil tanks. It could be deduced that this special machine was modified for a long distance or endurance competition. \n\nI would identify this machine as a Hanriot monoplane (1912)", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-5958596691-72157635425317914", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "5958596691"}, "flarchive:created": 1387806706}
