As they all shared somewhat the basic form of a Taube as designed and patented by the first designer Igo Etrich (an Austro-hungarian) through time they became generally knowns as Taubes. \n\nThis picture shows an advanced one example only Taube designed by <b>Halberstadt</b> in 1914. This designed used the patented wooden fuselage construction of the German aircraft designer <b>Hans R\u00f6ver (1890-1917)</b>. The streamlined design of the fuselage - although heavy - resulted in the highest top speed for a Taube, about 128 km/hr. The machine was never acquired by the German Army and remained a prototype only. \n\nThe machine can best be identified as <b>Halberstadt Taube Experimental 1914 (R\u00f6ver patent fuselage)</b>", "authorname": "Varese2002", "id": "49465936-5958596635-72157635135923309", "iconfarm": 4}, {"permalink": "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/5958596635/#comment72157635145404772", "realname": "SDASM Archives", "path_alias": "sdasmarchives", "author": "49487266@N07", "iconserver": "4070", "datecreate": "1376935941", "_content": "[http://www.flickr.com/photos/varese2002] Thanks!", "authorname": "San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives", "id": "49465936-5958596635-72157635145404772", "iconfarm": 5}], "photo_id": "5958596635"}, "flarchive:created": 1387806708}
