John and I served together in the USAF from 1968-1970.  He and I were close friends.  After leaving the Air Force, I stayed at Admiral Eckstrom's house in Coronado for a period of time.  The Admiral and I were the official &quot;dog feeders&quot; (1/2 can - 1/2 dry).  Their house was magnificent.   I ended up going to medical school and ended up in Canandaigua NY.  In 1991, I got a call from John stating that he had developed a brain tumor.  I reviewed his CT scans for him but nothing could be done.  John died shortly after that.  John was a great man, and so was his father from the little I knew when I stayed at their house.\nBen Lankheet MD", "authorname": "lankheet", "id": "49465936-4729088102-72157625341912706", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4729088102"}, "flarchive:created": 1389596685}
