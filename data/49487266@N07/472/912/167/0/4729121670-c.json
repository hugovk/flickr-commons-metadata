Harris was flying a Loening monoplane with a modified aileron when the aileron began oscillating badly, pulling the control stick from his hands. Facing a certain crash, Harris bailed out of the stricken aircraft, landing in a backyard grape arbor at a house at 335 Troy St., suffering only bruises on his legs and hand from fighting with the control stick.  The Loening crashed into the side yard of a house at 403 Valley St, three blocks away. There were no injuries to anyone on the ground. For his survival Harris was awarded the first membership in the Caterpillar Club, a club for aviators who have bailed out of stricken aircraft and survived.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_R._Harris\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_R._Harris</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "49465936-4729121670-72157631754423990", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4729121670"}, "flarchive:created": 1389595199}
