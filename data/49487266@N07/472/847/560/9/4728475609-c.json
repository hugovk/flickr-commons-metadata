He claimed 352 aerial victories (345 against the Soviet Air Force and 260 of which were fighters) in 1,404 combat missions. He engaged in aerial combat 825 times while serving with the Luftwaffe. During the course of his career, Hartmann was forced to crash-land his damaged fighter 14 times. This was due to damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down or mechanical failure. Hartmann was never shot down or forced to land due to fire from enemy aircraft.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Hartmann\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Hartmann</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "49465936-4728475609-72157631754462661", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4728475609"}, "flarchive:created": 1389595195}
