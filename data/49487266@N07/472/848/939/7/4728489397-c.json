He flew the first airplane from which a parachute jump was made, in 1912.[1] Jannus was also the first airline pilot, having pioneered the inaugural flight of the St. Petersburg Tampa Airboat Line on January 1, 1914, the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using heavier-than-air aircraft.[2] The Tony Jannus Award, created to perpetuate his legacy, recognizes outstanding individual achievement in the scheduled commercial aviation industry and is conferred annually by the Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society founded in Tampa, Florida, in 1963.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jannus\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jannus</a>", "authorname": "Richard Arthur Norton  (1958- )", "id": "49465936-4728489397-72157631837531779", "iconfarm": 3}], "photo_id": "4728489397"}, "flarchive:created": 1389594654}
