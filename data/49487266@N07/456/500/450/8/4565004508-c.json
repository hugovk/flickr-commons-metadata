It is configured with two 165 gallon wing tanks and a 75 gallon tank on the centerline.  It may have recently arrived from the long ferry flight from the Philippines, and the crew chief has not had an opportunity to apply any squadron markings, e.g., a 12&quot; red stripe on the cowl centerline, both port &amp; starboard, and perhaps the red, white and blue pre-war rudder stripes.  Prior to their deployment from Porac Airdrome, south of Clark Field, the 69th FS acquired a batch of new P-47D-30s, having traded in their war-weary P-47D-16s and -21s.", "authorname": "Frank Emmett", "id": "49465936-4565004508-72157626496730228", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4565004508"}, "flarchive:created": 1389689394}
