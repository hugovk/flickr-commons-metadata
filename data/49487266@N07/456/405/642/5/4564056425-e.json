The Independence and the destroyer USS O\u00d5Brien (DD 975) have been moved closer to Taiwan.  The U.S. is concerned about the recent series of missile tests and military live-fire exercises conducted by the Chinese in waters off the coast of Taiwan.  Given the increased tension caused by these tests in an area where the U.S. has long standing interests, the movement of the two ships is being taken as a precautionary action.   The ships have been conducting operations in international waters between Taiwan and Okinawa since last week.  Other ships of the Indy Battle Group involved include the destroyer USS Hewitt (DD 966) and frigate USS McClusky (FFG 41).  Additionally, the Aegis cruiser USS Bunker Hill (CG 52) is operating in the vicinity of Taiwan in international waters.  The Independence, the Navy\u00d5s oldest operational ship, is the only permanently, forward deployed aircraft carrier and is home ported in Yokosuka, Japan.  The Viking is from Air Anti-Submarine Squadron 21.
