In this photograph, the aircraft is not yet a P-64. Siam ordered 6 of these NA-68s and to make a long story short, delivery was curtailed by virtue of the Japanese presence in the area. Remaining in the US, the aircraft were sent out to various training fields as pilot trainers and hacks. At that point, they received the P-64 designation, which was indicative of their war-making potential, even though they would never fire a shot in anger. One survives, at the EAA Museum, Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\n\nDoug MacPhail", "authorname": "macharvard", "id": "49465936-4561527905-72157625166153198", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4561527905"}, "flarchive:created": 1389704331}
