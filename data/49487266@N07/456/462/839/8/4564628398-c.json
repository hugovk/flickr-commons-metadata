Unfortunately that aircraft was not a success because the design was a taildragger, and did not reflect the coming of the jets, with their tricycle gear. In fairly short order, the design was modified in several ways, including the switch to tricycle gear, resulting in the XBT-28. Note the very tall canopy, which was modified after T-28A production began.\n\nDoug MacPhail", "authorname": "macharvard", "id": "49465936-4564628398-72157625169025330", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4564628398"}, "flarchive:created": 1389699071}
