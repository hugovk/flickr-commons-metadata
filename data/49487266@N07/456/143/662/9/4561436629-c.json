It shows an AT-6 in RAF markings, with the identifier NA66 on the rear fuselage. This not an NA-66, but more likely an NA-88, identical in most ways to the USAAF's AT-6C and AT-6D. These aircraft served in Commonwealth countries as Harvards Mk IIA and III.\n\nDoug MacPhail", "authorname": "macharvard", "id": "49465936-4561436629-72157625164473674", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4561436629"}, "flarchive:created": 1389754077}
