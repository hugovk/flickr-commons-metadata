This was one of the few times that the accounting number and the customer number were identical, with both being NA-50. The next fighter design in the family eventually became the P-64, but began as the NA-50A. When the British Purchasing Commission approached NAA to come up with another single seat fighter, the project was initially given the next designation in the series, NA-50B.
