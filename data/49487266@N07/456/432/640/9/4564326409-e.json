The weapons package consisted of two 2000lbs bombs, two AGM 88 Anti-Radiation missiles, and two AIM 9 Heat Seeking Sidewider missiles.  With 14,000lbs of ordnance, \u00d2Super Hornet\u00d3 took to the air weighing 62,000,400lbs with fuel.  The aircraft was piloted by form Marine aviator Mr. Jim Sandberg, a member of the Integrated Test Team (ITT), located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Super Hornet replaces the A-6 \u00d2Intruder\u00d3 which will end active naval service on 28 February 1997, and is the future programmed replacement for the F-14 \u00d2Tomcat\u00d3.  An evolutionary upgrade to the combat proven \u00d2C\u00d3 & \u00d2D\u00d3 series, Super Hornet will conduct both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat missions.  Improvements include increases in fuel capacity, engine power, mission radius (40%), weapons stations, aircraft surface area (25%), and it\u00d5s ability to remain on station during typical combat air patrol scenarios.  The \u00d2Super Hornet\u00d3 development program continues to be \u00d2on-time\u00d3 and under budget.  U.S. Navy Photo Courtesy McDonnell Douglas Corp.
