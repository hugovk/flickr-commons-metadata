Crashed and destroyed approx. 1145am 2 February 1989 at Kirby  near St Johnsburg, Vermont. Plattsburgh crew of CAPT Randall S.  Voorhees and CAPT Len J. Esterly Jr survived ejection.  Callsign 'HEAT 22'. .. Info from news clipping.....Aircraft took off from Plattsburgh AFB at 1050hrs as part of a two ship AAR sortie off the Maine coast. After the aeroplane leveled at 19 000ft, it tended to roll left.  At first Voorhees thought this was due to a weight imbalance  between the left and right fuel tanks, but the pilot of the other FB-111A flew behind HEAT 22 and reported the left external fuel tank (#3) was cocked 10 degrees outward.  The wings were moved forward but the tank remained cocked off.   Voorhees decided at 1133hrs to return to Plattsburgh and at 1140hrs declared an in flight emergency.  At 1146hrs, radio contact was  lost.  The crew had descended to 10 000ft and flew level for about five minutes before Voorhees said he felt a jerk to the left.  This was likely caused by the tank twisting out to 65 degrees.  As the FB-111A plunged at an estimated 7000fpm, Voorhees shouted \"Bail Out!\" and pulled his ejection handle at 7 220ft.  The module landed into a large Spruce tree, which penetrated the module and caused minor injuries to CAPT Voorhees' left leg...( Info from Raymund Santos and newspaper clippings via Brian Lindner.)"}, "tagspace": "IPTC", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "Caption-Abstract", "label": "Caption- Abstract"}, {"raw": {"_content": "inches"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "DisplayedUnitsX", "label": "Displayed Units X"}, {"raw": {"_content": "inches"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "DisplayedUnitsY", "label": "Displayed Units Y"}, {"raw": {"_content": "30"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "GlobalAngle", "label": "Global Angle"}, {"raw": {"_content": "30"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "GlobalAltitude", "label": "Global Altitude"}, {"raw": {"_content": "False"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "CopyrightFlag", "label": "Copyright Flag"}, {"raw": {"_content": "(Binary data 4711 bytes, use -b option to extract)"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "PhotoshopThumbnail", "label": "Photoshop Thumbnail"}, {"raw": {"_content": "8"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "PhotoshopQuality", "label": "Photoshop Quality"}, {"raw": {"_content": "Optimised"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "PhotoshopFormat", "label": "Photoshop Format"}, {"raw": {"_content": "3 Scans"}, "tagspace": "Photoshop", "tagspaceid": 0, "tag": "ProgressiveScans", "label": "Progressive Scans"}], "farm": 4, "server": "3474", "secret": "b3e7cacdfa", "camera": "", "id": "4564326659"}, "stat": "ok", "flarchive:created": 1389693343}
