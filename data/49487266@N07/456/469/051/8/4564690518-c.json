1973 A-4E 152023 became one of the first batch of sixty five \ntransferred to the then Israel Defense Force Air Force as direct US aid \nand attrition replacements.\n\nThe aircraft would have served with more than one squadron and its tail pipe \nlengthened to protect against infrared guided missiles plus other necessary\nmodifications.\n\nSo in April 1971 A-4E 152023 was officially struck off charge from the US Navy\nto fly attack missions for Israel from its territory.\n\nPlease follow these internet links for further insight:\n<a href=\"http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-mideast/israel/af/types/A-4E.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-mideast/israel/af/types/A-4E.htm</a>\n&quot;\u2026.. ex-US Navy A-4E delivered from February 1971 to 1973.&quot;\n152023 is among the list.\n<a href=\"http://a4skyhawk.org/2e/israel/israel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">a4skyhawk.org/2e/israel/israel.htm</a>\n'ISRAEL'\n<a href=\"http://a4skyhawk.org/2e/israel/israeli-skyhawk-combat.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">a4skyhawk.org/2e/israel/israeli-skyhawk-combat.htm</a>\n'Israeli Ayits (Vulture) in Combat'\nDue to losses incurred during the &quot;Yom Kippur War&quot;, \n46 more A-4E were transferred to Israel from the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.\nResearch place losses of Israeli Skyhawks at forty-eight. \n\nIsrael is extremely secretive about defense and little information is available publicly\nto enable research to match US Navy serial numbers to their Israeli ones.\n\nIt appears that after service with the IDFAF A-4E 152023 was one of several A-4E \nchosen by Israel Aerospace Industries for possible sale to Argentina, \npossibly its Naval air arm \u2013 \nthen refurbished and painted in overall light gray.\nThe sale fell through and the aircraft were then stored outdoors for eventual disposal\nInternet records are several years out of date as first date of record is year 2005:\n<a href=\"http://a4skyhawk.org/2e/israel/israel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">a4skyhawk.org/2e/israel/israel.htm</a>\n\nSo the actual fate of A-4E 152023 is a little obscure.\n\nEvidence for the above may also be gleaned by copying this hyperlink to \na search engine and selecting translate:\n<a href=\"http://www.zonamilitar.com.ar/foros/threads/todo-sobre-el-a-4-skyhawk.12859/page-71\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.zonamilitar.com.ar/foros/threads/todo-sobre-el-a-4-sk...</a>\nscrolling down using slider bar on right to a cryptic reference to those that may \nhave been selected for sale to Argentina may be viewed\u2026\u2026..\n\nEnglish translation appears as thus:\n\u201cThe A-4E Ayit of Israel who were for the Navy were 12. \n(According to Nu\u00f1ez Padin in Naval No. 24)\u201d \n\nBuNo. \n3 150 092-A-301 \n3 151 056-A-302 \n3 151 120-A-303 \n3 151 164-A-304 \n3 151 994-A-305 \n3 152 019-A-306 \n3 152 023-A-307 \n3 152 030-A-308 \n3 152 044-A-309 \n3 152 050-A-310 \n3 152 078-A-311 \n3 152 097-A-312\n\nUse of \u2018Google Map\u2019 satellite image of Ovda Airport/Air Base reveals forty aircraft hulks in lines to the south west side of the airfield area.
