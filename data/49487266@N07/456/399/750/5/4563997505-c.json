These aircraft were not new production, but rather the result of an extreme upgrade and modification process. The aircraft involved were all originally AT-6Cs and Ds, but after the upgrade, they received new construction numbers and serial numbers, as T-6Gs. For the most part, the original serial numbers have been lost because they were of no importance. Once completed, some of the T-6Gs went into USAF service, while others were presented to foreign governments under the MDAP.\n\nDoug MacPhail", "authorname": "macharvard", "id": "49465936-4563997505-72157625078648219", "iconfarm": 0}], "photo_id": "4563997505"}, "flarchive:created": 1389699094}
