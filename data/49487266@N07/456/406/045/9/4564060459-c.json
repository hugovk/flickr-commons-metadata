He flew with VAQ-132 as a bombardier-navigator. \nThe plane's callsign was \n&quot;Swamp Fox 6-1-5.&quot; My dad's handle was &quot;Doc.&quot; I have a number of pictures of this aircraft that clearly show my dad in his &quot;office,&quot; and would glady send a couple of scanned JPEGS your way if you think they may add to your history in any positive way. My dream has been to find my dad's old aircraft, and to actually take a picture of it in its present condition, if such \na thing is possible. Dad died of cancer back in 2001, and finding his plane one last time would be a kind of catharsis for me. \nBut according to your site, after arriving at AMARC in 1990, the aircraft disposition is unknown.\nWilliam L.
