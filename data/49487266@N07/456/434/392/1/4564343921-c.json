Clamp of the 63rd Fighter Squadron, 56th FG was flying P-47C serial 41-6329 on a bomber escort mission to Villecoublay on 26 June 1943. Bounced by elements of the Luftwaffe's JG-26, the engagement resulted in a mauling for the 'Thunderbolt' unit. Four pilots were killed, and ten returning P-47s badly damaged. LT Ralph Johnson, on the advice of group commander 'Hub' Zemke, abandoned his aircraft over the Channel with no hydraulic power (for landing flaps) and only one main wheel down. Three other P-47s were written off after they landed, including 329. The day was most famous (or infamous) for LT Robert S. Johnson's harrowing near-shootdown described (with considerable embellishment by co-author Martin Caidin) in his combat autobiography, 'Thunderbolt.'", "authorname": "g.asher", "id": "49465936-4564343921-72157625142193041", "iconfarm": 2}], "photo_id": "4564343921"}, "flarchive:created": 1389691804}
