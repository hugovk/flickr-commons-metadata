Less specialized than contemporary, short-tailed pterodactyloid pterosaurs such as Pterodactylus, it had a long tail, stiffened with ligaments, which ended in a characteristic diamond-shaped vane. The jaws of Rhamphorhynchus housed needle-like teeth, which were angled forward, with a curved, sharp, beak-like tip lacking teeth, indicating a diet mainly of fish and insects.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamphorhynchus\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamphorhynchus</a>", "authorname": "darthjenni", "id": "12383156-11306570704-72157638669277336", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "11306570704"}, "flarchive:created": 1387855759}
