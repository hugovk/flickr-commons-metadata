It is the largest known ground sloth, as big as modern elephants, and would have only been exceeded in its time by a few species of mammoth. The group is known primarily from its largest species, M. americanum. Megatherium species were members of the abundant Pleistocene megafauna, large mammals that lived during the Pleistocene epoch. They were endemic to Central and South America that lived from the late Pliocene through the end of the Pleistocene.\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatherium\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatherium</a>", "authorname": "darthjenni", "id": "12383156-11032430816-72157638798009266", "iconfarm": 8}], "photo_id": "11032430816"}, "flarchive:created": 1387851125}
