By the 1800s the hospital was falling into disrepair. Lanesborough House was demolished to make way for a new 350-bed facility. Building began in 1827 under architect William Wilkins. The new hospital was operational by 1844, serving continuously as a hospital until transferred to Tooting, south London in the 1970s, leaving the Hyde Park Corner premises vacant in 1980. Rosewood Hotels and Resorts refurbished and re-opened the building as a hotel in 1991. Ten years later the management contract passed to Starwood's St Regis operation as its first and only hotel in England.\nIn 2009, The Lanesborough announced the launch of \u2018Apsleys \u2013 a Heinz Beck Restaurant\u2019. This is Chef Heinz Beck\u2019s first restaurant outside Italy. Beck has been the recipient of numerous awards for outstanding achievement throughout a long and prestigious career. He was awarded three-Michelin stars for his cuisine at La Pergola in Rome, Italy. \u2018Apsleys \u2013 a Heinz Beck Restaurant\u2019 began service on September 7, 2009, and was awarded its first Michelin star on 20 January 2010. This is the current fastest time for a new London restaurant to get one, in fewer than 5 months.[", "authorname": "Gordon Calder - Thanks for 2.3 million views!", "id": "12383156-11259945064-72157638704383825", "iconfarm": 4}], "photo_id": "11259945064"}, "flarchive:created": 1388172019}
